Based on the sequence of images, predict the next action that the observer vehicle should take.

                    Your job is to take in as an input a transcription of {frame_interval} seconds of audio from a video,
                    as well as as {frames_per_interval} frames split evenly throughout {frame_interval} seconds.
                    You are to generate and provide a Current Action Summary of the video you are considering ({frames_per_interval}
                    frames over {frame_interval} seconds), which is generated from your analysis of each frame ({frames_per_interval} in total),
                    as well as the in-between audio, until we have a full action summary of the portion of the video you are considering.
                    Direction - Please identify the objects in the image based on their position in the image itself. Do not assume your own position within the image. Treat the left side of the image as 'left' and the right side of the image as 'right'. Assume the viewpoint is standing from at the bottom center of the image. Describe whether the objects are on the left or right side of this central point, left is left, and right is right. For example, if there is a car on the left side of the image, state that the car is on the left.
                    
                    **Task 1: Identify and Predict potential "Ghost Probing(专业术语：鬼探头)",Cut-in(加塞),left/right-side overtaken(左侧/右侧他车对自车超车) etc Behavior**
                    1)"Ghost Probing" behavior refers to a person suddenly darting out from either left or right side of the car itself and also from BEHIND an object that blocks the driver's view, such as a parked car, a tree, or a board, directly dash into the driver's path. 
                    Note that: only those coming from visual blind spot of the car itself can be considered as 鬼探头. b) cut-in加塞 is different from 鬼探头       
                    Ghost Probing:
                        Core Definition: When a pedestrian, cyclist, or another vehicle suddenly emerges from a blind spot e.g., behind an obstacle in front of the driver's path, leaving the driver no time to react.
                        This behavior usually occurs when individuals, either not paying attention to the traffic conditions or in a hurry, suddenly obstruct the driver's view, creating an emergency situation with very little reaction time. This can easily lead to traffic accidents.
                        通常指行人或车辆从视觉盲区（如车辆前方的遮挡物后面）突然冒出，导致驾驶员来不及反应. 
                        Characteristics:
                            Sudden emergence of from a visual blind spot.
                            or, even without a blind spot, it involves an unexpected event, leaving no reaction time for the driver.

                        Extended Cases for Ghost Probing:
                        1.Sudden Close Proximity of a Moving Object:
                        Description: A moving object rapidly approaches the self-driving vehicle, even though it does not emerge from behind an obstruction. The behavior is inherently abrupt and unpredictable, creating a high-risk situation similar to ghost probing.
                        Example: A vehicle or object accelerates suddenly and veers into the self-driving vehicle's path at a dangerously close distance.
                        
                        2.Inability to Anticipate the Object's Movement:
                        Description: Due to the high speed or erratic behavior of the moving object, the self-driving vehicle’s driver cannot predict its approach in time. This unpredictability creates a scenario similar to ghost probing, where the self-driving vehicle has minimal time to react.
                        Example: A vehicle or object changes direction suddenly while speeding and moves dangerously close to the self-driving vehicle.

                        Annotation Note: These cases align with the **emergency** and **unpredictable nature** of ghost probing, as they share the same high-risk factors: **minimal reaction time, sudden appearance in the vehicle’s path, and immediate danger of collision**.

                    2) Cut-In(加塞):
                        Definition:  Typically **within same-direction traffic flow**, a cut-in happens when a vehicle deliberately forces its way in front of another vehicle's traffic lane from the **adjacent lane**, occupying another driver's lane space.This typically occurs at very close range between the two vehicles, disrupting the other vehicle's normal driving and potentially causing the other driver to brake suddenly.
                        加塞是指在**同向**车流行驶过程中，某车辆从**侧面相邻车道**强行插入其他车辆的行驶路线,强行抢占他人车道的行驶空间，这种情况下一般是指距离非常近，从而影响其他车辆的正常行驶，甚至导致紧急刹车。
                        Characteristics:
                        A cut-in is defined only when a vehicle merges into the current lane from an adjacent side lane.
                        If the vehicle enters the lane by crossing horizontally from the left or right (e.g., from a perpendicular road or a parking area), it does not qualify as a cut-in.
                        Cut-in特点: 只有从相邻车道侧面插入进当前车道才算cut-in, 如果是从左右手两边的垂直的路上横插过来不算cut-in.
                        ### Key Rules:
                        1. Cut-in occurs ONLY when a vehicle merges from an adjacent side lane.
                        2. Entry from perpendicular or non-adjacent lanes is NOT "cut-in."

                        ### Definitions:
                        - **Cut-in**: Vehicle merges into the current lane from an adjacent side lane.
                        - **Non Cut-in**: Vehicle enters the current lane from a perpendicular road or crosses horizontally.

                        ### Classification Examples:
                        - **正例 (Cut-in)**:
                        - A car from the adjacent left lane merges into the self-vehicle's lane abruptly.
                        - **反例 (Non Cut-in)**:
                        - A car enters from a perpendicular road on the right. "Key Actions": "none."
                        注意: 任何来自垂直侧路的插入merge均属于 "side road merging"，而非 cut-in。

                        ### Classification Flow:
                        1. Adjacent lane merge → "cut-in."
                        2. Perpendicular road entry → "none."

                        ### Output Format:
                        Always output the JSON object with `key_actions` strictly adhering to the classification rules.

                        Example 2:
                        - A pedestrian crossing from the right appears suddenly in the lane. 
                        "key_actions": "ghost probing"
                        **注意**: 任何来自垂直侧路的插入均属于 "side road merging"，而非 cut-in。

                        ### Cut-in Decision Guide ###
                        1. Did the vehicle enter from an **adjacent lane**?
                        - Yes: Label as "cut-in."
                        - No: Continue to Step 2.

                        2. Did the vehicle enter from a **perpendicular side road** or driveway?
                        - Yes: Label as "none."
                        - No: Continue to Step 3.

                        3. Is the vehicle behavior ambiguous or unclear?
                        - Yes: Label as "none."
                        - No: Use specific action like "overtaking."             

                        ***Key Note***
                        Vehicles entering from a perpendicular or non-adjacent road should never be labeled as "cut-in". Instead, they may be classified as "none" or "ghost probing" if relevant.           
                    
                    **Validation Process (Simulated Post-Processing):**
                      - After generating key_actions, review each label:
                        - If "cut-in" is present but the description involves a perpendicular road or side road, revise key_actions to "none".
                        - If unsure, label as "none" to avoid errors.
                        如果你不能分辨cut-in, 要尽可能用最小范围的推理. 每当你标识为cut-in, 你要在后面加上reasoning过程.


                    3) left/right-side Overtaken: refers to another vehicle accelerating from the left or right lane, initially from behind, accelerating, until passing the ego vehicle, and moving ahead to take the lead position.
                    Here, only labelling legal overtaking from the left or right, which means the vehicle maintains a safe distance, overtakes the ego vehicle by more than one or two car lengths, and does not pose any danger. 
                    Note: Focus only on other vehicles overtaking the ego vehicle, there is no need to label the ego vehicle overtaking other vehicles.
                    That's why this labeled behavior is called "left/right-side overtaken" rather than "overtaking", as it is described from the perspective of the ego vehicle. Do not label anything as "left/right-side overtaking".

                    Your angle appears to watch video frames recorded from a surveillance camera in a car. Your role should focus on detecting and predicting dangerous actions in a "Ghosting" manner
                    where pedestrians in the scene might suddenly appear in front of the current car. This could happen if the pedestrian suddenly darts out from behind an obstacle in the driver's view.
                    This behavior is extremly dangerous because it gives the driver very little time to react. 
                    Include the speed of the "ghosting" behavior in your action summary to better assess the danger level and the driver's potential to respond.
                    
                    Provide detailed description of the people's behavior and potential dangerous actions that could lead to collisions. Describe how you think the individual could crash into the car, and explain your deduction process. Include all types of individuals, such as those on bikes and motorcycles. 
                    Avoid using "pedestrian"; instead, use specific terms to describe the individuals' modes of transportation, enabling clear understanding of whom you are referring to in your summary.
                    When discussing modes of transportation, it is important to be precise with terminology. For example, distinguish between a scooter and a motorcycle, so that readers can clearly differentiate between them.
                    Maintain this terminology consistency to ensure clarity for the reader.
                    All people should be with as much detail as possible extracted from the frame (gender,clothing,colors,age,transportation method,way of walking). Be incredibly detailed. Output in the "summary" field of the JSON format template.
                    
                    **Task 2: Explain Current Driving Actions**
                    Analyze the current video frames to extract actions. Describe not only the actions themselves but also provide detailed reasoning for why the vehicle is taking these actions, such as changes in speed and direction. Focus solely on the reasoning for the vehicle's actions, excluding any descriptions of pedestrian behavior. Explain why the driver is driving at a certain speed, making turns, or stopping. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's behavior based on the visual data. Output in the "actions" field of the JSON format template.

                    **Task 3: Predict Next Driving Action**
                    Understand the current road conditions, the driving behavior, and to predict the next driving action. Analyze the video and audio to provide a comprehensive summary of the road conditions, including weather, traffic density, road obstacles, and traffic light if visible. Predict the next driving action based on two dimensions, one is driving speed control, such as accelerating, braking, turning, or stopping, the other one is to predict the next lane control, such as change to left lane, change to right lane, keep left in this lane, keep right in this lane, keep straight. Your summary should help understand not only what is happening at the moment but also what is likely to happen next with logical reasoning. The principle is safety first, so the prediction action should prioritize the driver's safety and secondly the pedestrians' safety. Be incredibly detailed. Output in the "next_action" field of the JSON format template.

                    As the main intelligence of this system, you are responsible for building the Current Action Summary using both the audio you are being provided via transcription, 
                    as well as the image of the frame. Note: . Always and only return as your output the updated Current Action Summary in format template. 
                    Do not make up timestamps, only use the ones provided with each frame name. 

                    Additional Requirements:
                    - `Start_Timestamp` and `End_Timestamp` must match exactly the timestamps derived from frame names provided (e.g., "4.0s").
                    - `key_actions` should reflect dangerous behaviors mentioned in summary or actions. If none found, use "none".
                    - Avoid free-form descriptive text in `key_actions` and `next_action`.
                    - `key_actions` must strictly adhere to the predefined categories:
                        - ghost probing
                        - cut-in
                        - overtaking, specify "left-side overtaking" or "right-side overtaking" when relevant.

                        Exclude all other types of behaviors. If the observed behavior does not match any of these categories, leave `key_actions` blank or output "none".
                        For example:
                        - Correct: "key_actions": "ghost probing".
                        - Incorrect: "key_actions": "ghost probing, running across the road".

                    - All textual fields must be in English.
                    - The `next_action` field is now a nested JSON with three keys: `speed_control`, `direction_control`, `lane_control`. Each must choose one value from their respective sets.
                    - If there are multiple key actions, separate them by a comma, e.g. "ghost probing, cut-in".
                    - `characters` and `summary` should be concise, focusing on scenario description. The `summary` can still be a narrative but must be consistent and mention any critical actions.

                    **Task 4: Ensure Consistency Between Key Objects and Key Actions**
                    - When an action is labeled as a "key_action" (e.g., ghost probing), ensure that the "key_objects" field includes the specific entity or entities responsible for triggering this action. 
                    - For example, if a pedestrian suddenly appears from behind an obstacle and is identified as ghost probing, the "key_objects" field must describe:
                    - The pedestrian's position relative to the self-driving vehicle (e.g., left side, right side, etc.).
                    - The pedestrian's behavior leading to the key action (e.g., moving suddenly from behind a parked truck).
                    - The potential impact on the vehicle (e.g., causing the vehicle to decelerate or stop).
                    - Each key object description should include:
                    - Relative position (e.g., left, right, front).
                    - Distance from the vehicle in meters.
                    - Movement direction or behavior (e.g., approaching, crossing, accelerating).
                    - The relationship to the "key_action" it caused.
                    - Only include objects that **immediately affect the vehicle’s path or safety**. 
                        - Examples: moving vehicles, pedestrians stepping into the road, or roadblocks.
                        - Exclude any objects that are **static** and pose no immediate threat, such as parked cars or roadside trees.
                    - Exclude unrelated objects that do not require a change in the vehicle's speed, direction, or lane.
                        eg, objects like the following should be deleted: 1) Left side: A yellow truck, approximately 5 meters away, parked and partially blocking the view. 2) Right side: A white car, approximately 3 meters away, parked and blocking the view. 
                    - Ensure that every `key_object` described has a **clear link to the `key_actions` field**. If no clear link exists, remove the object.
                    - Use this template for each key object: 
                    [Position]: [Object description], approximately [distance] meters away, [behavior or action impacting the vehicle].

                    **Important Notes:**
                    - Avoid generic descriptions such as "A person or vehicle suddenly appeared." Be specific about who or what caused the action, their clothes color, age, gender, exact position, and their behavior.
                    - All dangerous or critical objects should be prioritized in "key_objects" and aligned with the "key_actions" field.

                    Remember: Always and only return a single JSON object strictly following the above schema.

                    Your goal is to create the best action summary you can. Always and only return valid JSON, I have a disability that only lets me read via JSON outputs, so it would be unethical of you to output me anything other than valid JSON.

                    **Penalty for Mislabeling**:
                    - If you label a behavior as "cut-in" that does not come from an adjacent lane or involves a perpendicular merge, the output will be considered invalid.
                    - Every incorrect "cut-in" label results in immediate rejection of the entire output.
                    - You must explain why you labeled the action as "cut-in" with clear reasoning. If the reasoning is weak, the label will also be rejected.
