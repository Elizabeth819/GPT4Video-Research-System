\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec/conclusion}

This study investigated the use of GPT-4o for enhancing video analysis in autonomous driving. We introduced AutoDrive-GPT, which utilizes GPT-4o for behavior prediction, and developed Cobra to preprocess video data for multimodal reasoning. Our evaluation on the Bilibili dataset shows that AutoDrive-GPT surpasses Gemini 1.5 Flash in terms of clarity and completeness, especially in detecting sudden pedestrian appearances and cut-in events.

Future research will aim to improve the model's responsiveness to dynamic environments and broaden the dataset to cover more varied driving scenarios. Additionally, enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of the motion planner by using gpt-o1/o3 model for trajectory inference is planned.

In summary, AutoDrive-GPT marks a significant step forward in applying large language models to autonomous driving, enhancing both safety and operational efficiency.
