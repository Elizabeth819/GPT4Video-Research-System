Traffic ahead is moderate with multiple heavy trucks farther left. Mid-segment, a male on foot (approx. 35–45 years old, dark jacket, dark pants) suddenly bursts out from the right sidewalk area from behind the wall/hedges and sprints diagonally left into the lane at an estimated 4–5 m/s. He was fully hidden by the wall and vegetation until emergence, appearing just a few car-lengths ahead and then within 1–2 meters of the front bumper. A small scooter traveling ahead near the right edge remains farther forward and does not interfere. The sudden emergence directly into the lane presents an immediate collision risk consistent with ghost probing.\",\n  \"actions\": \"The vehicle proceeds straight at a steady urban speed on the right side of the roadway, maintaining lane as the scene is initially clear. When the male on foot suddenly emerges from behind the right-side wall and hedges into the lane very close ahead, the vehicle initiates hard braking to rapidly cut speed and avoid impact. Steering remains largely straight to preserve stability and because adjacent space is limited by traffic ahead on the left.\",\n  \"key_objects\": \"1) Right side: Adult male on foot wearing a dark jacket and dark pants, approximately 8–10 meters away at first appearance and closing to about 1–2 meters, sprinting from behind the wall/hedges into the lane, directly forcing the vehicle to brake. 2) Right side: Continuous wall with dense hedges, approximately 6–12 meters ahead along the curb, creating a visual obstruction that completely hid the man until he emerged, causing the ghost probing hazard.\",\n  \"key_actions\": \"ghost probing\",\n  \"next_action\": {\n    \"speed_control\": \"rapid deceleration\",\n    \"direction_control\": \"keep direction\",\n    \"lane_control\": \"maintain current lane\"\n  }\n}"
