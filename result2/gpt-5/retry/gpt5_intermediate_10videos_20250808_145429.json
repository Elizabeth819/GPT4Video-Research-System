As the vehicle proceeds forward, two males on foot suddenly step out from the left side from behind the parked white/orange sedan and adjacent box truck and move rightward into the lane at a brisk walking speed (~1–1.5 m/s). Their emergence is abrupt with minimal warning due to the parked vehicles blocking sight, placing them 2–4 meters ahead of the vehicle's path and forcing immediate collision-avoidance.

A cyclist is visible farther ahead near the right curb but does not immediately interfere.\",\n  \"actions\": \"The vehicle is traveling at a low urban speed, slightly right-of-center to pass the parked vehicles on the left. When the two males suddenly emerge from behind the parked sedan and box truck into the lane, the driver initiates hard braking and holds a straight trajectory with a slight right offset to maximize clearance while staying within the lane.
