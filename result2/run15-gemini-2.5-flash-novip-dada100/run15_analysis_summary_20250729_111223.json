The vehicle immediately reacts to this unexpected appearance, successfully avoiding a collision. After the child clears the path, the vehicle continues its forward movement.",
      "actions": "The vehicle is initially maintaining a steady forward speed as it navigates the road. Upon the sudden and unexpected appearance of a child running from behind a building on the left side of the road (around the 5-6 second mark), the vehicle's driver immediately initiates a deceleration, likely applying brakes, to prevent a potential collision. This rapid reduction in speed is a direct and necessary response to the immediate and unforeseen obstruction in the vehicle's path. After the child has safely crossed and cleared the vehicle's trajectory, the vehicle appears to resume its forward motion, indicating a controlled recovery from the braking maneuver.",

At approximately 6.0 seconds, upon the sudden and unexpected appearance of a pedestrian from behind a building on the right side of the road, the vehicle initiated rapid deceleration and emergency braking. This immediate and forceful braking action was taken due to the pedestrian's sudden entry into the vehicle's direct path, which created an unavoidable and high-risk collision scenario with extremely limited reaction time for the driver. The vehicle's speed was drastically reduced to prevent an impact with the pedestrian.",

      "summary": "The scene takes place on a busy urban street during a rainy day. The camera vehicle is stationary or moving at an extremely slow pace, positioned behind a red compact car. There is significant pedestrian activity, with a large group of students initially gathered on the right sidewalk near a gas station, and then beginning to cross the street. A green and blue bus passes the camera vehicle on the left. As the bus clears the view, a pedestrian holding a large checkered umbrella suddenly emerges from behind it on the left side of the road, darting into the vehicle's potential path. This sudden appearance from behind the moving obstruction constitutes a 'ghost probing' incident, creating an immediate potential hazard.",
      "actions": "The vehicle is observed to be stationary or moving at an extremely slow pace throughout the segment. This action is primarily dictated by the presence of a stationary red compact car directly ahead, indicating a halt in traffic flow or congestion. Furthermore, the high volume of pedestrian traffic, particularly a large group of students and other individuals crossing the street from both the right and later the left, necessitates extreme caution and a reduced speed or complete stop to ensure pedestrian safety. The sudden appearance of a pedestrian from behind a passing bus (a 'ghost probing' event) further validates the vehicle's cautious or stopped state, as it prevents a potential collision and prioritizes the safety of the crossing pedestrian.",

      "characters": "Initially, a person wearing a pink top is seen walking on the left side of the road. Later, several adults are observed standing and interacting near parked cars on the right side of the road. Towards the end of the segment, a person wearing a dark jacket and sunglasses is seen riding a blue scooter/motorcycle, emerging from the right side of the central median.",
      "summary": "The video segment begins with the autonomous vehicle driving on a street lined with buildings and parked cars. A pedestrian is initially seen walking on the left side of the road. As the vehicle progresses, it encounters a section on the right side of the road where several cars are parked and multiple individuals are gathered, suggesting a potential obstruction or a social interaction. The vehicle navigates past this area, transitioning onto a wider road characterized by a central median with lush green bushes. At the 10.0-second mark, a person riding a scooter or motorcycle suddenly emerges from behind these bushes on the right side of the central median, darting into the vehicle's potential path, creating an immediate hazard.",
      "actions": "The vehicle initially proceeds forward on a street with parked cars. As it approaches a cluster of parked vehicles and pedestrians gathered on the right side of the road (between 2.0s and 6.0s), the vehicle appears to slow down and carefully navigate this potentially congested area. This action is taken to ensure pedestrian safety and to avoid collision with parked vehicles or individuals. After passing this section, the vehicle transitions onto a wider road, maintaining its forward movement. The sudden appearance of a scooter at 10.0s indicates an immediate need for the driver to react to avoid a collision.",
      "key_objects": "1) Position: Right side of the road: A central median with dense green bushes, approximately 5-10 meters ahead, acting as a significant visual obstruction. 2) Position: Right side of the road: A person riding a blue scooter/motorcycle, approximately 5-10 meters ahead, suddenly emerging from behind the central median's bushes, directly entering the vehicle's path.",
