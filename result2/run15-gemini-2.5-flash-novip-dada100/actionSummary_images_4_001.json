  "summary": "The video segment, captured at dusk or night with streetlights illuminated, depicts a dynamic driving scenario. The vehicle is initially stationary or moving very slowly. At the beginning of the segment, a male cyclist, dressed in dark clothing and a cap, suddenly appears from the left side of the image, emerging from behind a building and quickly crossing the vehicle's path. The vehicle reacts by slowing down or stopping to avoid impact. Once the cyclist has passed, the vehicle begins to move forward cautiously. However, at approximately 6.0 seconds into the segment, another individual, a male pedestrian also in dark clothing and a cap, unexpectedly emerges from the left side of the image, from behind a line of trees or foliage, and proceeds to cross the road directly in front of the vehicle. This second sudden appearance necessitates another immediate reaction from the vehicle, which decelerates or stops to ensure the pedestrian's safety, highlighting two distinct 'ghost probing' incidents within a short timeframe.",
  "actions": "The vehicle begins the segment either stationary or moving at a very low speed. At approximately 0.0s, a cyclist suddenly appears from the left side of the image, emerging from behind a building and entering the vehicle's immediate path. In response, the vehicle maintains its low speed or applies brakes to come to a complete stop, prioritizing collision avoidance. After the cyclist clears the path by 2.0s, the vehicle initiates a slow acceleration to proceed forward. However, at approximately 6.0s, a pedestrian unexpectedly emerges from the left side of the image, from behind a visual obstruction (trees/foliage), and begins to cross the road directly in front of the vehicle. The vehicle immediately responds by decelerating or braking again to yield to the pedestrian and prevent a potential collision, demonstrating a safety-first approach.",
  "key_objects": "1) Position: Left side of the image. Object description: A male cyclist wearing dark clothing and a cap, riding a bicycle. Distance: Initially approximately 5-10 meters away. Behavior impact: Suddenly emerged from behind a building/structure on the far left, directly entering the vehicle's path with minimal reaction time, causing the vehicle to decelerate or stop to avoid collision. This is a traditional ghost probing incident.\n2) Position: Left side of the image. Object description: A male pedestrian wearing dark clothing and a cap. Distance: Initially approximately 10-15 meters away (at 6.0s), then closing to 5-10 meters. Behavior impact: Suddenly emerged from behind a visual obstruction (trees/foliage) and began crossing the road directly in front of the vehicle, requiring the vehicle to decelerate or stop to ensure safety. This is also a traditional ghost probing incident.\n3) Position: Right side of the image, further back. Object description: A white van. Distance: Approximately 20-30 meters away. Behavior impact: Parked, acting as a potential visual obstruction for anything emerging from behind it.\n4) Position: Right side of the image, further back. Object description: A white car. Distance: Approximately 20-30 meters away. Behavior impact: Parked, acting as a potential visual obstruction for anything emerging from behind it.",
