  "summary": "The video begins with the autonomous vehicle navigating a street with parked cars lining both sides. The vehicle proceeds at a slow, cautious speed. At approximately 3.5 seconds into the sequence, a critical 'ghost probing' incident occurs: a person riding a red scooter suddenly emerges from behind a dark blue/purple parked sedan on the left side of the road. This parked vehicle served as a complete visual obstruction, making the scooter rider's presence undetectable until they abruptly entered the vehicle's direct path. The autonomous vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration and comes to a complete stop to prevent a collision with the scooter rider, who continues to cross the road and exits the frame to the right. The road ahead then appears clear.",
  "actions": "The vehicle initially maintains a slow, steady forward speed, navigating a street with parked cars on both sides. Upon the sudden appearance of a person on a scooter from behind a parked car on the left side of the road, the vehicle executes a rapid deceleration, bringing itself to a complete stop. This action was taken as an immediate safety response to the unexpected obstruction entering its path, demonstrating a critical maneuver to avoid a potential collision and prioritize safety.",
  "key_objects": "1) Left: A person on a red scooter/motorcycle, emerging from behind a dark blue/purple parked sedan. This object suddenly appeared from behind a visual obstruction, directly entering the vehicle's path, necessitating immediate braking to avoid a collision.",
