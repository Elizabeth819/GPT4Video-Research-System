  "characters": "A person on a bicycle or scooter, wearing a light-colored jacket, crosses the road from the right side of the image towards the left. Other pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks and crossing the street in the background.",
  "summary": "The video captures a dashcam view from a vehicle driving on a wet urban road with moderate traffic. The weather appears overcast or rainy, as indicated by the active windshield wipers and wet road surface. As the vehicle approaches a pedestrian crossing, a person on a bicycle or scooter suddenly emerges from behind a line of parked cars on the right side of the road, darting directly into the vehicle's path. The vehicle rapidly decelerates to avoid a collision, allowing the person to cross safely. Other vehicles are present on both sides of the road, and tall buildings line the street.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially moving forward at a moderate speed on a wet road. Upon the sudden appearance of a person on a bicycle/scooter from behind parked vehicles on the right side of the road, the vehicle rapidly decelerates and comes to a near stop. This action is taken to prevent a collision with the person who unexpectedly entered the vehicle's path, demonstrating a necessary defensive driving maneuver in response to an immediate hazard. The vehicle's wipers are active throughout the sequence, indicating the need for clear visibility due to rain or wet conditions.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A person on a bicycle/scooter, approximately 5-10 meters away, suddenly emerges from behind parked cars and crosses the vehicle's path, causing an immediate need for the vehicle to brake.",
