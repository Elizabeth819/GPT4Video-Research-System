  "summary": "The video segment begins with the autonomous vehicle stopped at an intersection on a wet road, likely due to rain, as indicated by the active windshield wipers. A red octagonal stop sign is prominently visible on the right side of the road, indicating a mandatory stop. After a brief pause, the vehicle initiates a slow acceleration and proceeds straight through the intersection, carefully crossing a marked pedestrian crosswalk. Traffic density appears low, with only one white car observed moving in the opposite direction on the left side of the road. The overall weather conditions are overcast with visible rain.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially stopped at the intersection. This action is taken in direct response to the visible red octagonal stop sign located on the right side of the road, which mandates a full stop before proceeding. After the stop, the vehicle begins to accelerate slowly and moves forward. The cautious and slow acceleration is a deliberate response to the wet road conditions caused by the rain, aiming to maintain optimal traction and control while navigating through the intersection and ensuring safety.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A red octagonal stop sign, indicating a mandatory stop for the vehicle before proceeding through the intersection. 2) Center: A pedestrian crosswalk, marked on the road, which the vehicle crosses after initiating movement. 3) Environment: The road surface is wet due to rain, which influences the vehicle's speed control and requires cautious driving. 4) Left side: A white car, observed moving in the opposite direction on the left side of the road, but not posing an immediate threat or ghost probing scenario.",
