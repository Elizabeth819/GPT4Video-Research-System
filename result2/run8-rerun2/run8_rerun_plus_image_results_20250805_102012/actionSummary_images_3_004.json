  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a woman with a backpack suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, also creating a collision risk. In the third sequence, a man in a yellow shirt runs across the road from the left side, hidden by a parked vehicle, again creating a dangerous situation. The final sequence shows pedestrians crossing at an intersection, but they are visible throughout the sequence without any visual obstructions.",
  "actions": "The child on the right side suddenly runs into the road, the woman with a backpack on the left side suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle, and the man in a yellow shirt runs across the road from the left side.
