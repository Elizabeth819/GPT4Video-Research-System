  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. In the second sequence, an adult runs across the road from the left side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. Both instances create immediate collision risks. Additionally, cyclists are seen in the background, adding to the complexity of the situation.",
