  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side of the road. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the right side of the road. These sudden appearances create immediate collision risks.",
