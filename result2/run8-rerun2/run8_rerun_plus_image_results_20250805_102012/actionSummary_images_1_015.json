  "characters": "Multiple pedestrians, including a child and an adult, cyclists, and drivers. The pedestrians and cyclists are moving unpredictably, creating potential hazards.",
  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian quickly crosses the road from the left side, emerging from behind a parked van. In the third sequence, a cyclist appears from behind a parked truck on the left side, entering the driving lane. Each of these instances involves a physical obstruction that blocks the driver's view, creating immediate danger and potential collision situations.",
