  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from the left side, hidden by a parked van, also creating a collision risk. In the third sequence, a cyclist suddenly emerges from the right side, hidden by a tree and roadside structures, entering the driving lane. In the fourth sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from the right side, hidden by a building structure, entering the intersection.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
