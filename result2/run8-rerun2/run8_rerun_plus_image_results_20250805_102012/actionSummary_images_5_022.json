  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from the left side, hidden by a parked van, also creating a collision risk. In the third sequence, a cyclist and a pedestrian suddenly emerge from the right side, hidden by a parked truck, again creating a collision risk. In the fourth sequence, a vehicle suddenly emerges from behind a building at an intersection, entering the main road perpendicular to the camera vehicle's path, creating a collision risk.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and vehicles from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
