  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side of the road, crossing the path of the observer vehicle. In the third sequence, a cyclist suddenly emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side of the road, entering the driving lane. These instances create immediate danger and potential collision situations.",
