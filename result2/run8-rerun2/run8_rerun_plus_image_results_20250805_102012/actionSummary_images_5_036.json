  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first set of images, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the image, from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the driving path. In the second set, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the right side, crossing the road. In the third set, a person in a yellow jacket runs from the right side of the image, from behind a parked vehicle, into the driving path. In the fourth set, a large truck suddenly emerges from behind a building at an intersection, entering the main road perpendicular to the camera vehicle's path.",
  "actions": "The child and pedestrians are crossing the road from the right side to the left side, creating immediate collision risks. The large truck is entering the main road from a perpendicular direction, hidden by a building until the last moment.",
