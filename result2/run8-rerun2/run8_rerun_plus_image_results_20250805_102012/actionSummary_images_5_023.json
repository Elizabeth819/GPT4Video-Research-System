  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a cyclist suddenly emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, entering the driving lane. In the fourth sequence, a motorcyclist suddenly appears from behind a building at an intersection, entering the main road perpendicular to the camera vehicle's path.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
