  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a man in a yellow jacket suddenly runs across the road from the left side, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating another immediate collision risk.",
