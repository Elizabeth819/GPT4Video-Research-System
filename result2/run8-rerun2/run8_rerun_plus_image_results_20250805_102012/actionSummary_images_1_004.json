  "characters": "Multiple pedestrians, including a child and an adult, and cyclists observed in different sequences. The child is seen darting out from the right side of the image, and an adult male is seen running from the left side of the image.",
  "summary": "The video sequences show multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the image from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult male runs from the left side of the image, also from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. Both instances involve sudden appearances from behind obstructions, making detection impossible until the last moment.",
  "actions": "The child and adult male both exhibit sudden darting behavior from behind parked vehicles, directly into the driving path of the observer vehicle. This creates a high-risk situation requiring immediate action.",
  "key_objects": "Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, pedestrians, and cyclists. The parked vehicles create visual obstructions that hide the pedestrians until they suddenly appear in the driving path.",
