  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night in an urban area with street lights and shops on both sides. Initially, there are pedestrians and cyclists on the right side of the road. At around 2 seconds, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, followed by an adult. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child was hidden by the parked vehicles and the roadside structures until the moment of emergence, creating an immediate collision risk. The vehicle needs to take immediate action to avoid a collision.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is moving forward at a moderate speed. A child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, followed by an adult. The vehicle needs to decelerate and possibly brake to avoid a collision.",
