In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a pedestrian in a yellow jacket suddenly runs across the road from the left side, hidden by parked vehicles. In the fourth sequence, a cyclist in a red jacket suddenly emerges from the right side, hidden by a bus, directly entering the driving lane.",
