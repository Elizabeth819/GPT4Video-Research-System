  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a cyclist suddenly emerges from behind a parked truck on the left side, entering the driving lane. In the fourth sequence, a motorcyclist on the right side of the road is moving at a high speed, posing a potential collision risk.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
