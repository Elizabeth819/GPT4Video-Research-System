In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. In the second sequence, an adult male runs into the road from the left side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. Both instances create immediate collision risks due to the sudden appearance from behind obstructions.",
