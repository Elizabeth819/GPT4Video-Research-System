  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of potential 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side, crossing the road. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked truck on the left side, entering the driving lane. The final sequence shows a crowded street with pedestrians and cyclists moving unpredictably, creating a high-risk environment.",
