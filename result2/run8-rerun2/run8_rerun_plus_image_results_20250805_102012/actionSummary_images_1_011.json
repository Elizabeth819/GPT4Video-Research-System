  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night in an urban area. Initially, the road is clear, but a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, followed by an adult. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child and adult were hidden by parked vehicles and roadside structures until the moment of emergence, creating an immediate collision risk.",
