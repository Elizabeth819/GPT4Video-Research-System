  "characters": "Multiple pedestrians, including a child and an adult, cyclists, and drivers. The child is wearing a blue jacket and is seen darting into the road from the right side. The adult is also on the right side, possibly accompanying the child. Other pedestrians and cyclists are visible in the background.",
  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night and during the day in different scenarios. In the night sequence, a child suddenly darts into the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the day sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, also creating a collision risk. Both instances are clear cases of 'ghost probing' as the pedestrians were completely hidden by the parked vehicles until the moment of emergence.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is driving at a moderate speed. In the night sequence, the child suddenly appears from the right side, requiring immediate braking. In the day sequence, the pedestrian with a child appears from the left side, also requiring immediate braking.",
  "key_objects": "Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, pedestrians, cyclists, and street lights. The parked vehicles create visual obstructions, hiding the pedestrians until they suddenly appear.",
