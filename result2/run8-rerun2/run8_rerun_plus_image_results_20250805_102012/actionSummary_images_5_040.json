  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side, again creating a dangerous situation. The third sequence shows a cyclist emerging from behind a parked truck on the left side, directly entering the driving path. The fourth sequence shows a pedestrian crossing the road from the right side, hidden by a building structure, leading to a potential collision scenario.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and a cyclist from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
