  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night in an urban area with street lights and shops on both sides. Initially, the scene appears normal with vehicles and pedestrians visible on both sides of the road. However, at around 4 seconds, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. This creates an immediate collision risk as the child was previously hidden from view.",
