  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving through a busy urban area at night. There are multiple vehicles on the road, including a black car on the left side and a white car on the right side. A child suddenly appears from the right side of the road, darting into the driving lane. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child was hidden by the parked vehicles and other obstructions until the moment of emergence, creating an immediate collision risk.",
