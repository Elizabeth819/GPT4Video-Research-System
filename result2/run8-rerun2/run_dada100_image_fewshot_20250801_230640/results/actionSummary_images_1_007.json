  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night in an urban area with street lights and shops on both sides. Initially, the scene appears normal with vehicles and pedestrians visible. However, at around 4 seconds, a child suddenly runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child was completely hidden by the parked vehicle until the moment of emergence.",
