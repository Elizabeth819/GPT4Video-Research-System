  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first set of frames, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In another sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, again posing a collision threat. Additionally, a cyclist is seen emerging from behind a parked truck on the left side, entering the driving lane abruptly. The final sequence shows a bus partially obstructing the view, with a pedestrian suddenly appearing from behind it, leading to a collision.",
