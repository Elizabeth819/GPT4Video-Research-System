  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night on a road with streetlights and some traffic. At around 2 seconds, a child suddenly runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle. The child is followed by a woman who appears to be trying to catch up with the child. The child falls in the middle of the road, and the woman reaches the child and helps them up. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child was completely hidden by the parked vehicle until the moment of emergence, creating an immediate collision risk.",
