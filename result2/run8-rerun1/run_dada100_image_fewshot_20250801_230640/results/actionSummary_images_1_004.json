  "summary": "The video sequences show multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs from the right side of the road, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult runs from the left side of the road, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, again creating an immediate collision risk. In the third sequence, a cyclist is seen riding on the right side of the road, but no sudden emergence is observed.",
  "actions": "The child and adult both suddenly appear from behind parked vehicles, creating immediate danger. The cyclist is riding on the right side of the road without sudden movements.",
