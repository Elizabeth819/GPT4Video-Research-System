  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving through a busy street at night. Initially, the scene appears normal with vehicles and pedestrians visible on both sides of the road. Suddenly, a child emerges from the right side of the road, running across the street, creating an immediate collision risk. This is a clear case of 'ghost probing' as the child was hidden by parked vehicles and roadside structures until the moment of emergence.",
  "actions": "The child runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind parked vehicles and roadside structures. The vehicle needs to take immediate action to avoid a collision.",
