In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly in the path of the observer vehicle. In the third sequence, a cyclist and a pedestrian emerge from behind parked vehicles on the right side, again creating a sudden and dangerous situation. The final sequence shows a pedestrian running across the road from the left side, hidden by a van, leading to a near-collision.",
