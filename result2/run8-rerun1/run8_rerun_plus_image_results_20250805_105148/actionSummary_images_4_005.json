  "characters": "Multiple pedestrians, including a child and an adult, and cyclists observed in various frames. The child and adult are seen crossing the road suddenly from the right side in the first sequence. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child on their back emerges from the left side. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from the right side.",
  "summary": "The video sequences show multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly runs into the road from the right side, followed by an adult. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child on their back emerges from the left side, crossing the road. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from the right side, crossing the road in front of the vehicle.",
  "actions": "The child and adult in the first sequence suddenly appear from behind parked vehicles on the right side, creating an immediate collision risk. The pedestrian with a child in the second sequence emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, also creating a sudden hazard. The cyclist in the third sequence emerges from the right side, crossing the road in front of the vehicle.",
