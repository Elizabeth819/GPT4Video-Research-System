  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first set of images, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. In the second set, an adult pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, crossing the road. In the third set, a cyclist emerges from behind a tree on the right side, entering the road. In the fourth set, a cyclist appears from behind a large structure on the right side, crossing the intersection.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions.",
  "key_objects": "Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, trees, a large structure at the intersection, and moving vehicles.",
