In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the image from behind a parked vehicle, directly entering the driving lane. In the second sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from the left side of the image from behind a parked vehicle, entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from the right side of the image from behind a parked vehicle, entering the driving lane. All instances create immediate collision risks due to the sudden appearance from behind obstructions.",
