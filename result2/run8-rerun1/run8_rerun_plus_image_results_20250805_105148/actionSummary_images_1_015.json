  "characters": "Multiple pedestrians, including a child and an adult, and cyclists observed in various scenes. The pedestrians and cyclists are moving unpredictably, creating potential hazards.",
  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side, crossing the road. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked truck on the left side, entering the road. These sudden appearances from behind obstructions create immediate collision risks.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind parked vehicles and other obstructions. These emergences occur with minimal reaction time, requiring immediate braking to avoid collisions.",
  "key_objects": "Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, pedestrians, cyclists, and moving vehicles. The parked vehicles create visual obstructions, hiding the pedestrians and cyclists until they suddenly appear in the driving path.",
