  "summary": "The video sequence shows a series of dangerous situations involving pedestrians and cyclists suddenly emerging from behind obstructions. In the first sequence, a child suddenly appears from the right side of the road, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a cyclist suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the right side, entering the driving lane. These are clear cases of 'ghost probing' as the pedestrians and cyclists were completely hidden by the parked vehicles until the moment of emergence, creating immediate collision risks.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind parked vehicles, requiring immediate braking to avoid collisions.",
  "key_objects": "Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, pedestrians, cyclists, and the observer vehicle.",
