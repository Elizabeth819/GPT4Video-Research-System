  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first set of images, a child suddenly runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second set, a pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side, entering the driving lane. In the third set, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked truck on the left side, directly entering the path of the vehicle.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and cyclists from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and collision avoidance maneuvers.",
