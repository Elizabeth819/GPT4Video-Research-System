  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of ghost probing behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the right side, directly entering the driving lane. In the second sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the right side, entering the driving lane. These instances create immediate collision risks due to the sudden appearance from behind obstructions.",
