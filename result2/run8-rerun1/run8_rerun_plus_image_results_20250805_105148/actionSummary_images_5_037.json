  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night in an urban area. Initially, the road is clear with some parked vehicles on the right side. Suddenly, a child runs from the right side of the road, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. This creates an immediate collision risk. In another sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side of the road, crossing the road in front of the observer vehicle. In the final sequence, a motorcyclist emerges from the right side of the road, entering the observer vehicle's lane.",
