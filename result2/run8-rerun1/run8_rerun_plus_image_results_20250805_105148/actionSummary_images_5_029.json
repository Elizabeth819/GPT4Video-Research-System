  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of ghost probing behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the right side, directly into the driving lane. In the second sequence, an adult emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, also directly into the driving lane. Both instances create immediate collision risks. Additionally, there are cyclists and other pedestrians visible in the background, adding to the complexity of the scene.",
