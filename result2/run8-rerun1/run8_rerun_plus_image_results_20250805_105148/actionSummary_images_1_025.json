  "summary": "The video sequences show multiple instances of ghost probing behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a pedestrian suddenly runs across the road from the left side, hidden by a parked vehicle. In the fourth sequence, a cyclist suddenly appears from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, entering the driving lane.",
  "actions": "In the first sequence, the child emerges from the right side of the road. In the second sequence, the pedestrian with a child emerges from the left side. In the third sequence, the pedestrian runs across the road from the left side. In the fourth sequence, the cyclist emerges from the left side.",
