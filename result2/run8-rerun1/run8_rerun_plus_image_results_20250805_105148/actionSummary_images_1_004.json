  "summary": "The video sequences show multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a young man runs from the left side of the road, also from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. Both instances involve sudden appearances from behind obstructions, making detection impossible until the last moment.",
  "actions": "In the first sequence, the child emerges from the right side of the road from behind a parked vehicle. In the second sequence, a young man runs from the left side of the road from behind a parked vehicle. Both actions create immediate collision risks.",
