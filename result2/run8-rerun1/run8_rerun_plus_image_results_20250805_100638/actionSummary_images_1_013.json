  "summary": "The video sequence shows several instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a pedestrian with a child suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side, directly entering the driving lane. In the third sequence, a man in a yellow shirt darts out from the left side of the road, hidden by a parked truck, causing a dangerous situation. Finally, a bus suddenly emerges from the right side, hidden by trees, with a pedestrian crossing in front of it, creating a high-risk scenario.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences of pedestrians and a bus from behind obstructions, requiring immediate braking and evasive maneuvers.",
