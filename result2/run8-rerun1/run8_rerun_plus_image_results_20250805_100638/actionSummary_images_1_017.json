  "summary": "The video sequence shows multiple instances of 'ghost probing' behavior. In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, from behind a parked vehicle, directly into the path of the observer vehicle. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from behind a parked van on the left side of the road, again entering the driving lane with minimal reaction time. In the third sequence, a cyclist emerges from behind a parked truck on the right side, creating an immediate collision risk. The final sequence shows a vehicle emerging from behind a bus on the left side, entering the main road perpendicular to the observer vehicle's path.",
  "actions": "The observer vehicle encounters multiple sudden emergences from pedestrians and vehicles, requiring immediate braking and evasive maneuvers.",
