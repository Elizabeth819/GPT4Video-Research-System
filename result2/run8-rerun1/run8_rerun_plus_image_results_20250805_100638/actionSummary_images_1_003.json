  "summary": "The video sequence shows a vehicle driving at night on a well-lit street. Initially, the road appears clear, but at around 2 seconds, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the image, directly into the vehicle's path. The child was previously hidden by a physical obstruction (a parked vehicle). This is a clear case of 'ghost probing'. The vehicle needs to take immediate action to avoid a collision. Subsequently, a woman in a pink jacket appears to assist the child.",
