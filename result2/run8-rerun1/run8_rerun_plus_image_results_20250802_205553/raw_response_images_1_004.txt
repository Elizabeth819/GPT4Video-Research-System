In the first sequence, a child suddenly appears from the right side of the image, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, a woman with a child emerges from behind a parked vehicle on the left side, directly entering the driving path. In the third sequence, a man runs across the road from the left side, creating a sudden obstacle. In the fourth sequence, a pedestrian is seen walking on the right side of the road, but no immediate danger is posed.",
