    "summary": "The vehicle is traveling on a road with trees on both sides. A red bus appears ahead, initially at a distance, and gradually approaches the self-driving vehicle. As the bus gets closer, a male pedestrian wearing a blue shirt suddenly emerges from behind the bus on the right side of the road. The pedestrian's sudden appearance from behind the bus creates a ghost probing situation.",
