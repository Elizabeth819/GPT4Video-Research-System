  "summary": "The vehicle is driving into a tunnel. Several people are walking inside the tunnel. A male, approximately 20 years old, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and a black backpack, is kneeling in the middle of the road, directly in the vehicle's path. Another male is riding a scooter. The kneeling man is a significant hazard, and the scooter could also become a ghost probing incident if it suddenly changes direction.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially driving at 23 km/h and decelerates to 0 km/h as it approaches the tunnel entrance due to the presence of people in the roadway. The driver is likely slowing down to assess the situation and avoid a potential collision with the kneeling man or other pedestrians.",
