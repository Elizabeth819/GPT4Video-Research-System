There are also motorcyclists on the road.",
  "summary": "The vehicle starts driving on a city street with moderate traffic. A large bus is in front of the vehicle, partially obstructing the view. As the vehicle approaches an intersection, pedestrians and motorcyclists are visible crossing the street. The vehicle slows down as it approaches the intersection.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially driving behind a bus, maintaining a safe following distance. As the vehicle approaches an intersection, the driver slows down, likely in anticipation of potential pedestrian or vehicle traffic. The driver is proceeding cautiously due to the presence of the bus obstructing the view and the activity at the intersection.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right: A large bus is driving in front of the vehicle, obstructing the view of the road ahead.
