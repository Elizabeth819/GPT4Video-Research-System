  "summary": "The vehicle is approaching an intersection. Initially, the vehicle is behind a white van, obscuring the view of the intersection. As the vehicle approaches the intersection, other vehicles and pedestrians become visible. At timestamp 9.0s, another white van emerges from the right side of the road, potentially creating a ghost probing scenario.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially moving forward, following the white van in front. As the vehicle approaches the intersection, it maintains its speed, likely preparing to cross the intersection if the traffic light allows. The vehicle is maintaining its lane.",
