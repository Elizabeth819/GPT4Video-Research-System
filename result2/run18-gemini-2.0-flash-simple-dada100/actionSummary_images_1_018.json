  "summary": "The vehicle is driving on a street with parked cars on both sides. Pedestrians are crossing the street in the middle of the road. The vehicle maintains its speed initially, then slows down as it approaches the pedestrians. The pedestrians are crossing from left to right. The vehicle continues driving after the pedestrians have crossed.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is driving straight on a road with parked cars on both sides. The vehicle maintains its speed initially, then decelerates as it approaches pedestrians crossing the road.
