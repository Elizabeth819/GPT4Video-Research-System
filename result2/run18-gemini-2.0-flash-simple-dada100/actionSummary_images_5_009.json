  "characters": "The scene shows a driver in a car on a city street. There are other cars on the road, and pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks. A motorcyclist wearing a red helmet appears from behind an obstruction.",
  "summary": "The vehicle is driving on a city street with moderate traffic. Initially, the car maintains its lane and speed. As the car approaches an intersection, a motorcyclist suddenly appears from behind a large, covered object on the left side of the road, creating a potential ghost probing situation. The driver likely needs to react to avoid a collision.",
  "actions": "The vehicle is initially driving straight, maintaining its speed and lane. As it approaches the intersection, the driver likely prepares to slow down or stop due to the presence of the intersection and potential cross-traffic. The appearance of the motorcyclist from behind the obstruction would necessitate braking to avoid a collision.",
  "key_objects": "1) Left side: Large covered object, close distance, obstructs view of cross-traffic. 2) Left side: Motorcyclist wearing a red helmet, emerging from behind the covered object, close distance, poses immediate collision risk.",
