Once the light turns green, the vehicle accelerates and proceeds straight through the intersection. After clearing the intersection, the vehicle maintains a consistent speed while driving straight down the road. The initial stop is due to the traffic light, and the subsequent acceleration and straight driving are due to the green light and the desire to continue along the current path.",
