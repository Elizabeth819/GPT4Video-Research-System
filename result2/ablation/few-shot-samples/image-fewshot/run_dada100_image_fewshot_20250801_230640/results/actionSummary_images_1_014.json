In the first set of images, a child suddenly appears from the right side of the road, emerging from behind a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second set, a pedestrian suddenly crosses the road from the left side, emerging from behind a parked van. In the third set, a cyclist and a pedestrian emerge from behind parked vehicles on the right side, entering the driving lane. In the fourth set, a child runs across the road from the right side, emerging from behind a building.",
