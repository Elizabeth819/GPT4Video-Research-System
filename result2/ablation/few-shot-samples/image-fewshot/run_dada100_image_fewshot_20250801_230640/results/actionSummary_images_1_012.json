In the first sequence, a child suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, hidden by a parked vehicle, creating an immediate collision risk. In the second sequence, an adult pedestrian suddenly appears from the left side, hidden by a parked van, also creating a collision risk. In the third sequence, a cyclist and a pedestrian suddenly emerge from the right side, hidden by a parked truck, creating another immediate collision risk. In the fourth sequence, a pedestrian suddenly appears from the right side, hidden by parked cars, creating a collision risk.",
