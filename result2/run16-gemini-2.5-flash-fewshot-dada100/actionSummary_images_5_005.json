  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is navigating an urban or industrial road, approaching a wide intersection or open area. Large trucks are present on both sides of the road, with a prominent red dump truck positioned on the right side, acting as a significant visual obstruction. As the vehicle proceeds, a motorcycle and its rider suddenly emerge from behind the red dump truck on the right side of the road, directly into the vehicle's path. The motorcycle appears to be falling or has just fallen, and the rider is seen on the ground or in the process of getting up. This sudden appearance from behind an obstruction with minimal warning time constitutes a dangerous ghost probing incident.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially proceeding with caution, likely at a moderate speed, given the presence of large trucks and the nature of the road environment which suggests a construction or industrial zone. Upon the sudden and unexpected emergence of the motorcycle and rider from behind the red dump truck on the right side of the road at approximately 8.0 seconds, the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration and braking. This action is taken to prevent a collision with the fallen motorcycle and its rider, prioritizing immediate safety due to the sudden and unannounced appearance of the obstacle.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A large red dump truck, approximately 15-20 meters away, serving as a significant physical obstruction that completely obscured the view of the approaching motorcycle and rider. 2) Center/Right: A motorcycle, approximately 5-7 meters away, suddenly appearing from behind the red dump truck and falling onto the road directly in the vehicle's path. 3) Center/Right: A male motorcyclist, approximately 5-7 meters away, wearing dark clothing and a yellow helmet, falling with the motorcycle and then attempting to get up, creating an immediate hazard.",
