  "characters": "A young child (toddler) in red pants and a striped shirt, approximately 3-5 years old.",
  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is navigating a narrow rural or semi-urban road with buildings and various obstructions on the right side. As the vehicle proceeds, a young child suddenly and unexpectedly darts out from behind a building and other roadside clutter on the right side of the road, directly into the vehicle's path. The child's appearance is sudden, with minimal warning, creating an immediate and dangerous 'ghost probing' situation. The vehicle appears to react by rapidly decelerating to avoid a collision.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially moving forward at a moderate speed. Upon the sudden emergence of the child from behind the building on the right side of the road (around 5.0s to 6.0s mark), the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration, likely emergency braking, to prevent a collision. This swift action is taken due to the unexpected and immediate threat posed by the child entering the vehicle's path with no prior visibility.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A young child, approximately 3-5 years old, wearing red pants and a striped shirt, suddenly emerging from behind a building and roadside clutter (such as construction materials and a parked scooter) and stepping directly into the vehicle's path, approximately 2-3 meters away. 2) Right side: A multi-story building and associated roadside clutter (including construction materials, a small cart, and a parked scooter), approximately 5-10 meters away, creating a significant visual obstruction that completely hid the child until their sudden emergence. 3) Left side: A red three-wheeled truck, approximately 10-15 meters away, approaching from the opposite direction.",
