  "characters": "A small child (girl), approximately 3-5 years old, wearing a pink dress, running into the road. An adult female, approximately 30-40 years old, wearing dark clothing, on the right side of the road, appearing to be with the child. An adult male, approximately 30-40 years old, wearing a blue shirt, exiting a silver car on the left side of the road.",
  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is traveling on a multi-lane urban road during daytime with moderate traffic. Initially, the vehicle maintains a steady course. As the vehicle approaches a roadside area, possibly a gas station or rest stop, a white SUV is observed on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the view. Suddenly, at approximately 10.8 seconds, a small child, a girl in a pink dress, emerges from behind this white SUV on the right side and runs directly into the vehicle's path. An adult female is also visible near the white SUV, seemingly reacting to the child. This sudden appearance of the child from behind the obstruction creates an immediate and dangerous ghost probing situation, requiring an urgent response to prevent a collision.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially maintaining a consistent speed and direction on the multi-lane road. Upon the sudden and unexpected emergence of the small child from behind the white SUV on the right side of the road, the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration and emergency braking. The primary reasoning for this action is to prevent a collision with the child who has unexpectedly entered the vehicle's direct path with minimal warning time, as the child was previously hidden by the parked vehicle.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A white SUV, approximately 5-10 meters away, parked or stopped on the roadside, serving as a significant visual obstruction. 2) Right side: A small child, a girl approximately 3-5 years old, wearing a pink dress, suddenly emerging from behind the white SUV and running directly into the vehicle's path, creating an immediate collision risk.",
