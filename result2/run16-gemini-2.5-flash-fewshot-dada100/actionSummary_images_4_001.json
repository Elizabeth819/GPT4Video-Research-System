  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is navigating an urban-like environment during dusk, characterized by artificial street lighting and roadside structures. As the vehicle appears to be making a slight right turn or path adjustment, a male cyclist suddenly emerges from the left side of the road. The cyclist appears to have come from behind a building or roadside structure that obstructed the driver's view, darting directly into the vehicle's path with minimal warning. This sudden appearance created an immediate and dangerous 'ghost probing' situation, requiring the vehicle to react quickly to avoid a collision.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle was in the process of making a slight right turn or path adjustment as it approached the area. Upon the sudden and unexpected emergence of the cyclist from the left side, who was previously obscured by a roadside structure, the vehicle immediately initiated a braking action and/or steering adjustment to avoid a collision. The vehicle successfully navigated around the cyclist, demonstrating a rapid and appropriate response to the sudden hazard.",
  "key_objects": "1) Left side: A male cyclist, approximately 20-30 years old, wearing dark clothing and a cap, suddenly emerging from behind a roadside building/structure and entering the vehicle's path. The cyclist was initially obscured from view, creating a minimal reaction time situation. 2) Left side: A building/roadside structure, approximately 5-10 meters away, acting as a visual obstruction that hid the approaching cyclist until they entered the road.",
