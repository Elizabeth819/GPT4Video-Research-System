  "characters": "Male pedestrian in a blue t-shirt and dark pants, approximately 20-30 years old. Other cyclists and pedestrians are visible on the right sidewalk later in the segment.",
  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is navigating an urban road with multiple lanes. As the vehicle approaches a marked crosswalk, a line of vehicles is stopped or moving slowly on the right side of the road, including a dark SUV positioned near the crosswalk. A male pedestrian suddenly emerges from behind this dark SUV on the right side, stepping directly onto the crosswalk and into the vehicle's path. The SUV acts as a significant visual obstruction, making the pedestrian's appearance sudden and unexpected, creating an immediate and dangerous 'ghost probing' situation with minimal reaction time for the driver.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially moving forward on the urban road. Upon the sudden and unexpected appearance of a male pedestrian from behind a dark SUV on the right side of the road at the crosswalk (around 5.0s-6.0s), the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration and applies braking. This decisive action is taken to prevent a collision with the pedestrian who entered the vehicle's path without prior warning due to the visual obstruction. The vehicle comes to a near stop to ensure the safety of the pedestrian.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A dark SUV, approximately 5-10 meters away, stopped near the crosswalk, serving as a physical obstruction that completely hid the pedestrian until their emergence. 2) Right side, then center: A male pedestrian, approximately 20-30 years old, wearing a blue t-shirt and dark pants, suddenly emerging from behind the dark SUV and stepping onto the crosswalk directly into the vehicle's path. At the point of emergence, he is approximately 3-5 meters away.",
