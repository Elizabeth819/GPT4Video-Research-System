  "summary": "The video segment begins with the self-driving vehicle approaching a road entrance or gate area. On the left side of the image, a white SUV is visible near a barrier, either entering or exiting the area. Simultaneously, a pedestrian wearing a red jacket is observed on the right side of the road, beginning to cross towards the left. As the vehicle proceeds, a silver van passes on the left side of the image. Further ahead in the center of the road, a group of approximately three to four pedestrians, including individuals in dark and blue jackets, are seen walking across the road from the right to the left. The vehicle slows down significantly to allow these pedestrians to safely cross its path. The scene depicts a routine interaction with pedestrians in a potentially busy area, with no sudden, obstructed emergences that would classify as 'ghost probing'.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially approaching a gate area at a moderate speed. Upon observing a pedestrian in a red jacket beginning to cross from the right side of the road (frames 1-3), and subsequently a group of pedestrians further ahead also crossing (frames 4-8), the vehicle initiates a controlled deceleration. This reduction in speed is a deliberate action to yield the right-of-way to the pedestrians and ensure their safe passage across the road, demonstrating a priority for pedestrian safety in a shared road environment. The vehicle comes to a near stop as the pedestrians pass directly in front of it.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A pedestrian wearing a red jacket, approximately 20-30 years old, initially walking along the right side of the road and then crossing towards the left, approximately 5-10 meters away. 2) Left side: A white SUV, approximately 5-10 meters away, moving slowly or stopped near a gate/barrier. 3) Left side: A silver van, approximately 5-15 meters away, moving past the gate/barrier. 4) Center: A group of 3-4 pedestrians, approximately 10-20 meters away, including one in a dark coat and two in blue jackets, walking across the road from right to left.",
