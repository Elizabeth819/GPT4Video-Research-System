  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is traveling on an urban road with multiple lanes, approaching a marked crosswalk. Initially, a white car is ahead in the same lane, and a black motorcycle is positioned to the right of the white car. As the vehicle approaches the crosswalk, the motorcycle, which was visible ahead, suddenly falls onto the crosswalk directly in the vehicle's path. The female rider dismounts or falls with the motorcycle. Simultaneously, a male pedestrian is observed walking from the left side of the crosswalk towards the right. This unexpected incident creates an immediate obstruction and a potential collision hazard on the crosswalk.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially maintaining a consistent speed while proceeding along the urban road. As the vehicle approaches the crosswalk, the motorcycle ahead suddenly falls onto the pedestrian crossing. In response to this unexpected and immediate obstruction, the vehicle initiates rapid deceleration and comes to a complete stop. This decisive action is taken to prevent a collision with the fallen motorcycle and its rider, and to ensure the safety of both the rider and the pedestrian who is also crossing the road. The vehicle prioritizes safety by stopping to allow the path to clear.",
  "key_objects": "1) Center-front: A black motorcycle, approximately 5-10 meters away, falling onto the crosswalk directly in the vehicle's path, creating an immediate obstruction. 2) Center-front: A female motorcycle rider, approximately 5-10 meters away, dismounting or falling with the motorcycle onto the crosswalk. 3) Left side: A male pedestrian, approximately 10-15 meters away, walking from the left side of the crosswalk towards the right, also in the vehicle's potential path.",
