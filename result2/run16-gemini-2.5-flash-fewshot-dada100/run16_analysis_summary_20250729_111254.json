The weather is overcast but visibility is good. Initially, the road ahead is clear. As the vehicle proceeds, a male pedestrian wearing dark clothing is observed walking on the right side of the road, moving towards the vehicle. Shortly after, a male cyclist wearing a light blue jacket is seen riding on the left side of the road, also approaching the vehicle. Both the pedestrian and the cyclist are visible from a distance and do not suddenly emerge from behind any physical obstructions. The vehicle continues its path without any sudden maneuvers, indicating a routine driving scenario.",
      "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and direction throughout the segment. There are no observed changes in speed (acceleration or deceleration) or direction (steering adjustments) as the pedestrian and cyclist are visible well in advance and do not pose an immediate threat or require evasive action.

As the male pedestrian suddenly emerges from behind the buildings on the right side of the road and steps into the vehicle's path (around 6.0s, becoming critical from 10.0s onwards), the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration. The driver likely also attempts evasive steering, possibly a slight left adjustment, to avoid a direct collision with the pedestrian who appeared unexpectedly from behind the visual obstruction.

On the left side of the road, a large green bus is seen moving forward, passing the self-driving vehicle and the red car. As the green bus proceeds, it creates a significant visual obstruction. Suddenly, a female pedestrian, holding a plaid umbrella, emerges from behind the moving green bus on the left side of the road, stepping directly into the vehicle's potential path.

In response to this unexpected 'ghost probing' event, the vehicle immediately initiates braking to reduce speed and prevent a potential collision with the pedestrian who has entered the roadway. The vehicle's action is a direct and necessary safety response to the sudden appearance of the pedestrian from a blind spot created by the moving bus.",

As the vehicle progresses, it approaches a busy intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights. Other vehicles are observed on the road, some moving and some stopped at the intersection. The vehicle gradually slows down and comes to a complete stop at the intersection, aligning itself in a lane that appears to allow for both straight movement and a left turn. There are no sudden or unexpected appearances of pedestrians, cyclists, or vehicles from behind obstructions that would constitute a 'ghost probing' incident. The overall driving scenario is a routine approach and stop at a traffic-controlled intersection.",
      "actions": "The self-driving vehicle initially maintains a steady speed as it approaches the intersection. Upon observing the increasing traffic density ahead and the presence of stopped vehicles at the intersection, the vehicle begins to decelerate. This deceleration is a controlled and deliberate action taken to safely reduce speed and prepare for a stop. The vehicle then comes to a complete stop, positioning itself in the appropriate lane, indicating a response to either a red traffic light or the flow of traffic ahead that has halted.",

      "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is initially stopped at a busy urban intersection during daytime, positioned behind a black Audi sedan and to the right of a white Hyundai sedan. Tall buildings line the streets. As the traffic light changes or the path clears, the vehicle begins to execute a left turn. While the vehicle is mid-turn, a female pedestrian suddenly emerges from the right side of the vehicle's immediate view, stepping into the crosswalk directly in the vehicle's turning path. Her appearance is sudden and from a blind spot created by the intersection corner and the vehicle's A-pillar, creating a dangerous ghost probing situation.",
      "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially stationary at an intersection, waiting for the traffic to proceed. As the black Audi in front begins to turn left, indicating a clear path or a green light, the self-driving vehicle also initiates a left turn. While executing the turn, a female pedestrian unexpectedly appears from the right side, entering the vehicle's path. In response to this sudden emergence, the vehicle appears to maintain a very slow speed or briefly decelerate to allow the pedestrian to safely cross the intersection, prioritizing pedestrian safety.",
      "key_objects": "1) Right side: A female pedestrian, approximately 30-40 years old, wearing a pink jacket and dark pants, suddenly emerging from behind the corner of the intersection/building and the vehicle's A-pillar, approximately 1-2 meters away, stepping into the vehicle's turning path. 2) Right side: The corner of the building at the intersection, acting as a visual obstruction that hides the pedestrian until her sudden emergence. 3) Front: A black Audi sedan, approximately 3-5 meters ahead, which initiates a left turn, influencing the self-driving vehicle's movement.",

      "characters": "A male pedestrian in a pink shirt (visible at 0.0s-1.0s), multiple adult individuals standing near parked cars on the right side of the road (visible at 3.0s-6.0s), and a person on a scooter/motorcycle wearing dark clothing and a blue helmet (visible at 10.0s-14.0s).",
      "summary": "The self-driving vehicle is navigating an urban road characterized by parked vehicles on both the left and right sides. In the initial moments, a male pedestrian crosses the road from the left side. As the vehicle proceeds, it approaches an area on the right side of the road where several cars are stopped or parked, and multiple people are standing around them, indicating a potential gathering or minor roadside event. Crucially, at approximately 10.0 seconds, a person on a scooter suddenly emerges from behind the cluster of parked vehicles and roadside structures on the right side of the road, darting directly into the vehicle's path. This sudden appearance from behind a significant visual obstruction, with minimal warning time, creates an immediate and dangerous 'ghost probing' situation, necessitating rapid evasive action from the self-driving vehicle.",
      "actions": "The self-driving vehicle initially maintains a cautious and appropriate speed for an urban environment, accounting for the presence of parked cars and the pedestrian crossing early in the segment. As the vehicle approaches the cluster of stopped vehicles and individuals on the right side of the road (around 5.0s-7.0s), it likely reduces its speed further and may make slight steering adjustments to safely navigate past this area of increased activity and potential obstruction. Upon the sudden and unexpected emergence of the scooter rider from the right side (starting around 10.0s), the vehicle immediately initiates rapid deceleration and braking to prevent a collision, as the scooter rider enters the vehicle's direct path with very little reaction time.",
      "key_objects": "1) Right side: A person on a scooter/motorcycle, initially appearing approximately 5-7 meters away, suddenly emerging from behind parked vehicles and roadside structures and crossing the vehicle's path from right to left. 2) Right side: A parked red SUV and other parked vehicles/roadside structures, located approximately 10-15 meters away, which collectively create a significant visual obstruction that completely hides the approaching scooter rider until their sudden emergence into the roadway.",
