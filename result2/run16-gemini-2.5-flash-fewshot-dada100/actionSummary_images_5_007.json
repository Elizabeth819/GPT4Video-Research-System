  "summary": "The self-driving vehicle is approaching and entering a complex urban intersection with a large overpass structure on the right side. This overpass creates a significant visual obstruction, hiding traffic approaching from a hidden road or ramp underneath it. At approximately 4.0 seconds, a dark SUV suddenly emerges from behind the overpass structure on the right, entering the intersection. Shortly after, at approximately 6.0 seconds, a police car also suddenly emerges from the same hidden area on the right, following the SUV into the intersection. Both vehicles appear with minimal warning, creating an immediate and dangerous 'vehicle ghost probing' situation. A person on a red scooter is also visible on the left side of the road, approaching the intersection.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is initially decelerating as it approaches the complex intersection, preparing to navigate the turn safely. Upon the sudden and unexpected emergence of the dark SUV from behind the right-side overpass structure, the vehicle immediately initiates further deceleration and prepares for potential evasive action to avoid a collision. This response is critical as the police car then immediately follows, also emerging unexpectedly from the same obstructed area. The vehicle's actions are a direct and necessary response to the sudden appearance of these vehicles from a blind spot, prioritizing safety by reducing speed and maintaining control to prevent an accident.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A large overpass structure, approximately 10-20 meters away, acting as a significant physical obstruction that completely hides vehicles approaching from a hidden road/ramp underneath it until they emerge into the intersection. 2) Right side: A dark SUV, approximately 5-10 meters away, suddenly emerging from behind the overpass structure and entering the intersection, creating a vehicle ghost probing incident. 3) Right side: A police car (white with blue/red markings), approximately 5-10 meters away, suddenly emerging from behind the overpass structure shortly after the SUV and entering the intersection, further contributing to the vehicle ghost probing incident. 4) Left side: A person on a red scooter, approximately 15-20 meters away, approaching the intersection.",
