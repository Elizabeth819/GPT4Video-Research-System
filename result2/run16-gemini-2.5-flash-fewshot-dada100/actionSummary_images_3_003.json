  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is approaching and proceeding through a busy urban intersection during daytime. The traffic light for the vehicle's direction is green. As the vehicle moves forward, a female cyclist suddenly emerges from the right side of the road, from behind a parked white vehicle and the corner of a building, directly entering the vehicle's path on the crosswalk. The cyclist was completely obscured by the obstruction until her sudden appearance, leading to an immediate collision with the vehicle.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is proceeding through the intersection, likely accelerating from a stop or slow speed, as indicated by the green traffic light. The vehicle continues its forward motion. Due to the sudden and unexpected emergence of the cyclist from behind a visual obstruction, there is minimal to no reaction time for the vehicle to take evasive action, resulting in a collision with the cyclist.",
  "key_objects": "1) Right side: A female cyclist, approximately 20-30 years old, wearing a brown jacket and black backpack, suddenly emerging from behind a parked white vehicle and the corner of a building, entering the crosswalk directly into the vehicle's path. 2) Right side: A parked white vehicle and the corner of a building, approximately 5-10 meters away, creating a significant visual obstruction that completely hid the approaching cyclist until her sudden emergence.",
