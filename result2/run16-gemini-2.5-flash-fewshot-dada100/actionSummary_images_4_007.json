  "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is positioned at an urban intersection under clear sky conditions. A male traffic police officer is standing prominently in the middle of the intersection, on the right side of the image, actively directing traffic. Throughout the 10 seconds, various vehicles, including a dark blue sedan, a light blue taxi, a white SUV, a silver sedan, and a person on a scooter/motorcycle, are observed moving across the intersection from both the left and right sides, passing in front of the self-driving vehicle. The traffic flow appears to be managed and orderly due to the officer's presence, with no sudden or unexpected emergences from behind visual obstructions.",
  "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is stationary or moving at a very low speed at the intersection from 0.0s to 10.0s. This action is taken to yield to cross-traffic and to comply with the traffic flow directed by the police officer present in the intersection. The vehicle maintains its position, allowing other vehicles and a scooter to pass safely through the intersection, indicating a cautious and compliant driving behavior in a controlled traffic environment. There is no acceleration or significant deceleration as the vehicle holds its position.",
