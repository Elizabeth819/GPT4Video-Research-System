As the car gets closer to the intersection, a person on a scooter suddenly appears from the right side of the road, crossing the intersection. The scooter is moving at a moderate speed, and the driver is wearing a dark jacket and a face mask. This sudden appearance constitutes a ghost probing incident, as the scooter was not visible until it entered the car's path.",
