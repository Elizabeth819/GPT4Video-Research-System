      "summary": "From 0.0s to 7.0s, the self-driving car is approaching an intersection. Initially, the road is relatively clear with a white van and a blue tricycle ahead. As the car approaches the intersection, a person on a scooter suddenly appears from the left side of the road at 6.2s. At 7.0s, the person on the scooter falls off the scooter directly in front of the car, creating a dangerous \"ghost probing\" situation. The speed of the scooter is moderate, but the sudden fall requires immediate braking to avoid a collision.",

The driver is maintaining a steady speed, likely assessing the traffic conditions and preparing to proceed through the intersection or stop if necessary. The speed is appropriate for the road conditions and traffic density.",
