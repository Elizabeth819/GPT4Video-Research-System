At approximately 5.9s, a person on a scooter, wearing a yellow jacket and blue pants, suddenly appears from the right side of the road at a crosswalk. This constitutes a potential ghost probing situation due to the sudden appearance and minimal reaction time. The scooter is moving at a moderate speed.",
