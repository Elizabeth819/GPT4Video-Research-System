From 4.0s to 13.6s, the car approaches an intersection with a gas station on the right. At 12.0s, a silver car is parked on the right side of the road. At 13.2s, a man in a blue shirt opens the driver's side door of the silver car, and a young girl in a pink dress starts to run across the road from behind the car. A woman holding a baby is standing on the sidewalk to the right of the parked car. This constitutes a ghost probing incident due to the sudden appearance of the child from behind the parked car.",
