      "summary": "The self-driving car is approaching an intersection with a traffic light. Initially, the view is partially obstructed by parked trucks on the right side. As the car moves forward, several large trucks become visible on the cross street. At 8.0s, a motorcyclist wearing a black jacket and yellow helmet suddenly appears from behind the truck on the left side of the road, crossing the street. The motorcyclist is moving at a moderate speed. This sudden appearance constitutes a ghost probing incident, requiring immediate braking to avoid a collision.",
