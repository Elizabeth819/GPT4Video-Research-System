  "summary": "The self-driving car is traveling on a two-lane road through a rural area with buildings on either side. From 0.0s to 5.0s, the car is driving straight on the road. From 5.0s to 15.0s, the car approaches an intersection. At 14.5s, a man wearing a white shirt and red pants is riding a motorcycle from the right side of the road, crossing the intersection. This constitutes a potential ghost probing scenario as the motorcycle emerges from behind a building, potentially requiring the car to decelerate or stop to avoid a collision.",
