At 3.1s, a male wearing a black jacket and black pants suddenly appears from behind a green three-wheeled vehicle on the right side of the road. He is bending over, seemingly picking something up from the ground. This constitutes a ghost probing incident as he was completely obscured before suddenly appearing in the vehicle's path.
