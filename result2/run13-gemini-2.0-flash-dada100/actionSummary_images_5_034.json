To the left, there is a person on a scooter waiting at the red light. To the right, there are people walking on the sidewalk. At timestamp 4.0s, the traffic light turns green, and the car and the scooter in front of it begin to move forward. At timestamp 10.7s, a person on a scooter suddenly appears from the left side of the road, crossing the road at a high speed, creating a ghost probing scenario. The car decelerates to avoid a collision.",
