  "summary": "The self-driving car is traveling on a straight road with light traffic. Initially, a white van is visible ahead. As the car progresses, the van remains in view, maintaining a consistent distance. At 3.2s, a white car appears from the left side of the road, potentially emerging from a side street or parking area. The white car is moving at a moderate speed. At 6.4s, a red car is visible far ahead in the same lane. At 7.2s, a person on a bicycle is visible on the left side of the road, moving in the same direction as the self-driving car. The cyclist is wearing dark clothing and is riding at a moderate speed.",
