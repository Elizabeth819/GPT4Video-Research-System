From 2.0s to 9.0s, a man in a white jacket and dark pants is seen on the left side of the road, attempting to start a scooter. The scooter is positioned at a perpendicular road, and the man is trying to get it started. The man is middle-aged. The scooter has some bags attached to the back. The man's actions could potentially lead to a ghost probing incident if he suddenly enters the road without checking for oncoming traffic.",
