  "actions": "The vehicle is driving straight on a road with buildings on the right and a long structure on the left. The vehicle maintains its speed until a motorcyclist suddenly appears from a perpendicular road on the right, at which point a collision occurs. The vehicle was likely maintaining its speed because the road appeared clear ahead, but the sudden appearance of the motorcyclist from the perpendicular road made the collision unavoidable.",
