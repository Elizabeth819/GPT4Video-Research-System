At 4.3s, a male on a bicycle, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, appears on the right side of the road. At 5.2s, a male wearing a white shirt and dark pants is kneeling in the middle of the road. At 6.1s, the car decelerates to 7 km/h. At 7.0s, the car is almost stopped, and at 7.8s, the car is stopped. The male kneeling in the middle of the road is now very close to the car.",
