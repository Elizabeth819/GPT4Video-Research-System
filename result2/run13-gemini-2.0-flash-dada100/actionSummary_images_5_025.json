From 5.0s to 11.9s, the car is passing through the intersection. At 7.5s, a motorcyclist wearing dark clothing is waiting at the crosswalk on the right side of the road. At 8.8s, the motorcyclist starts to cross the road. At 10.0s, the motorcyclist is in the middle of the road. At 11.1s, the motorcyclist has almost finished crossing the road. The motorcyclist's action of crossing the road while the car is passing through the intersection could be considered a potential ghost probing incident.",
