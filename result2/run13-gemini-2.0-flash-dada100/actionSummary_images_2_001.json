There are several people walking on the road, and motorcycles are moving in both directions. At 14.6s, a man in a black jacket is walking from behind a blue three-wheeled vehicle on the right side of the road, potentially creating a ghost probing situation if he continues to cross the street. The road conditions appear to be wet, and the traffic is dense.",
