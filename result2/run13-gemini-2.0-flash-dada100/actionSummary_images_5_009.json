  "summary": "The self-driving car is traveling on a multi-lane road with other vehicles present. Initially, the car is driving straight. From 13.3s to 13.9s, a male motorcyclist wearing a red helmet and a brown jacket suddenly appears from behind a large, covered object on the right side of the road, entering the self-driving car's lane. This constitutes a ghost probing incident. The motorcyclist's sudden appearance necessitates immediate action to avoid a collision. The self-driving car then makes a left turn at an intersection.",
