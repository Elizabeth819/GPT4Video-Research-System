    "summary": "The video shows the observer vehicle driving on a city road.  A man in dark clothing and a woman in red clothing exit a building on the right side of the road. The man appears to be carrying something.  The woman walks towards the man, and both then cross the road in front of the observer vehicle. The man and woman's crossing of the road is relatively slow, but their initial emergence from behind the building could be considered a potential 'ghost probing' event due to limited visibility before their appearance.",
