The traffic is relatively light, and the self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the car in front. No sudden or erratic movements are observed from other vehicles or pedestrians. The weather appears sunny and clear.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second segment.  The vehicle smoothly navigates the street, adjusting speed slightly to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.  There are no observable braking or acceleration maneuvers beyond minor adjustments to maintain a safe following distance.",

She is not directly in the path of the vehicle, but her proximity to the road and the parked cars could pose a risk if she were to suddenly step into the street. The traffic is relatively light, with cars parked along the right side of the road. The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the vehicles ahead. No immediate dangerous situations are observed, but the pedestrian's proximity to the road warrants caution.",
