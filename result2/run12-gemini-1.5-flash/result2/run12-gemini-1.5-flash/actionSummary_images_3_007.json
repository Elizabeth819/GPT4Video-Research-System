    "summary": "The video shows a young boy riding a bicycle. He appears to lose control of his bicycle and falls in the middle of the road.  The bicycle falls to the left side of the road, and the boy gets up and retrieves his bicycle. The incident occurs in a relatively busy road with other vehicles present. The boy's fall happens relatively quickly and unexpectedly.",

The vehicle's speed appears to be appropriate for the road conditions, maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.",

    "summary": "The video shows two young boys on bicycles crossing a road. One boy appears to have fallen or is struggling with his bicycle. An adult male is assisting him while another adult male walks alongside.  The boys and adults are crossing the road directly in front of the recording vehicle. The situation is potentially dangerous due to the sudden appearance of the children and the lack of sufficient time for the vehicle to react and brake.",
