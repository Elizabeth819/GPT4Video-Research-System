Between 7.8s and 10.0s, a soccer ball rolls across the road in front of the car, requiring the driver to react and potentially brake. The weather is rainy, and the road surface appears wet.",

The driver appears to be maintaining a safe following distance from other vehicles. The consistent speed suggests the driver is navigating a relatively clear road with no immediate need for acceleration or deceleration.",
