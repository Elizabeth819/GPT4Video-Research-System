A group of pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street with umbrellas.  A red car is visible ahead, moving at a similar speed.  Traffic is relatively dense, and the road is wet due to rain. No immediate dangerous events occur, although the wet road conditions and pedestrian activity require caution.",

The vehicle keeps a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and maintains its lane. The slow speed is likely due to the wet road conditions and the presence of pedestrians.",

A red car is ahead, and a motorcyclist is visible to the right, maneuvering around parked cars. Pedestrians with umbrellas are present on the sidewalks. The overall traffic flow is slow due to the rain and congestion. No immediate dangerous events are observed, although the conditions are potentially hazardous due to reduced visibility and slippery roads.",
