    "summary": "The video shows nighttime driving on a two-lane road with streetlights.  The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed. Around 4.9 seconds, a scooter rider wearing dark clothing crosses the road from left to right in front of the vehicle. The rider appears to be moving at a moderate speed. The distance between the scooter and the vehicle is not immediately apparent, but it appears close enough to warrant caution. Other vehicles are visible in the distance, but they do not pose an immediate threat.",
