    "summary": "The video shows a 10-second segment of urban driving. The observer vehicle maintains a consistent speed, gradually decreasing from 45 km/h to 32 km/h.  The traffic is relatively light. At approximately 7.8 seconds, a person on a red scooter, wearing a blue jacket and light-colored pants, merges into the observer vehicle's lane from the right side. This maneuver is relatively sudden, requiring the observer vehicle to slightly reduce speed to maintain a safe distance. No collision occurs.",
    "actions": "The observer vehicle maintains a consistent speed, gradually decelerating from 45 km/h to 32 km/h over the 10-second period. This deceleration is likely a response to the overall traffic conditions and the merging scooter. The vehicle maintains its lane and direction throughout the segment.",
