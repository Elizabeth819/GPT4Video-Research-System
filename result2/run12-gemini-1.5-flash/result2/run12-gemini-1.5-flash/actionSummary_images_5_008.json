Other vehicles are present, and the observer vehicle proceeds cautiously through the intersection, slowing down as it approaches the crosswalk and the traffic officer.",
    "actions": "The observer vehicle approaches and navigates a city intersection in rainy conditions. The vehicle slows down as it approaches the crosswalk and the traffic officer, indicating a response to the presence of pedestrians and the traffic control. The speed reduction is likely a precautionary measure to ensure safe passage through the intersection.",

As the self-driving vehicle approaches the crossing, the tricycle rider appears to be almost completely stopped, but then suddenly starts to move again, directly into the path of the vehicle. This results in a collision. The weather appears to be rainy.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is approaching a pedestrian crossing at a moderate speed. The vehicle maintains a relatively straight path.  There is no indication of braking or evasive maneuvers until after the collision.",
