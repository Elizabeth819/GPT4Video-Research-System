    "summary": "The video shows a vehicle driving on a narrow rural road.  The road is relatively clear but has some construction debris and parked vehicles on the sides. Several pedestrians are visible, including a young child. A tricycle and a scooter are also present.  Around the 5-second mark, a young child in red clothing runs out from between parked vehicles into the road, creating a near-miss situation. The driver of the vehicle appears to maintain a steady speed and remains alert to the surroundings.",
    "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed throughout the 10-second segment, adapting to the presence of other road users and obstacles. The driver appears to be cautiously navigating the narrow road, adjusting speed to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians.",
    "key_objects": "1) Right side: A young child, approximately 2 meters away at 5.6s, running from behind parked vehicles into the road. This caused the driver to maintain a cautious speed and potentially brake slightly. 2) Right side: A red tricycle, approximately 10 meters away at 0.0s, moving slowly in the same direction. 3) Right side: A white scooter, approximately 5 meters away at 7.8s, parked near the roadside.",
