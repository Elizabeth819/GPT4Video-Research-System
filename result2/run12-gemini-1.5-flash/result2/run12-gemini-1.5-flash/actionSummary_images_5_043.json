There are other vehicles present, including a yellow pickup truck parked on the right side of the road near the intersection and other cars moving in the same direction. The road is relatively clear, with no immediate hazards observed. The vehicle maintains a consistent speed throughout the 10-second segment.",

Around 14.7 seconds, a blue three-wheeled motorized cargo vehicle crosses the road from the right side, passing in front of the recording vehicle. The vehicle's speed is relatively low throughout the sequence. No immediate dangerous situations are observed, although the three-wheeled vehicle's crossing requires attention.",
