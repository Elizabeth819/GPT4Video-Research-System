    "summary": "The video shows a vehicle driving down a city street.  The road is relatively clear with some other vehicles and pedestrians visible. Traffic appears light to moderate.  No significant events or near misses occur during the 10-second segment. The vehicle maintains a consistent speed and stays in its lane.  Pedestrians are visible crossing at a crosswalk near the end of the sequence.",
    "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed and direction throughout the 10-second segment.  The driver appears to be following traffic laws and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.  The vehicle does not brake or accelerate significantly. The consistent speed suggests the driver is adapting to the flow of traffic.",

    "summary": "The video shows a vehicle approaching an intersection.  Pedestrians are visible crossing the crosswalk. Between frame 1 and frame 2, a collision occurs.  The vehicle's windshield is shattered, indicating a significant impact. The exact nature of the collision and the involved parties are unclear from the limited frames, but it appears a pedestrian or a vehicle may have been involved.",
    "actions": "The vehicle is initially driving straight at a seemingly moderate speed towards the intersection.  There is no indication of braking or evasive maneuvers before the collision. The sudden impact and windshield damage suggest a lack of reaction time.",
    "key_objects": "Front: Pedestrians crossing the crosswalk, approximately 5 meters away at the start of the sequence, then 0 meters away at impact.  The pedestrians' movement caused the collision. Right: A white van, approximately 10 meters away in the first frame, seemingly stationary and not directly involved in the collision.",
