    "summary": "The video shows a white sedan driving on a city street during a rainstorm. The road is wet, and visibility is somewhat reduced.  Several other vehicles are visible, moving in the same direction. At approximately 4.6 seconds, a person on a red scooter crosses the road from right to left in front of the self-driving vehicle. The scooter rider appears to be wearing dark clothing and is difficult to see clearly due to the rain and low light conditions. The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the vehicles ahead. No collisions occur.",
