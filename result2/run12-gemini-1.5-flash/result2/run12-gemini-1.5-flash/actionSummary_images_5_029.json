    "summary": "The video shows the observer vehicle driving on a city road.  Several other vehicles are present, including a white car directly ahead and other cars in the distance.  Around the 7-second mark, a person on a blue electric bicycle crosses the road from the right side, appearing suddenly from behind a small truck. This action could be classified as ghost probing due to the sudden appearance and limited reaction time for the observer vehicle. The observer vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the car in front throughout the sequence.",
    "actions": "The observer vehicle maintains a consistent speed and following distance from the vehicle directly ahead.  There are no observable changes in speed or direction during this segment. The vehicle navigates a typical urban road environment with other vehicles present.",
    "key_objects": "1) Right: Person on a blue electric bicycle, approximately 10 meters away at the time of crossing, suddenly emerging from behind a small truck, crossing the road directly in front of the observer vehicle. This action caused a potential near-miss situation.",

To the right, a person on an electric bicycle is visible, moving slowly along the sidewalk.  There are other vehicles in the distance. Over the 4.5 seconds shown, the observer vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the vehicle ahead. The electric bicycle rider poses no immediate threat.",
