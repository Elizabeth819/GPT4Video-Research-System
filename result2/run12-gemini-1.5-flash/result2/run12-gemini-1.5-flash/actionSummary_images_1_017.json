The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the car ahead. No sudden appearances of vehicles or pedestrians are observed. Traffic flow is moderate.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the vehicle in front throughout the 10-second segment.  The vehicle stays in its lane and does not make any turns or sudden braking maneuvers. The speed appears to be moderate, adjusting slightly to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead. This suggests a cautious and controlled driving style.",

The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and distance from the car ahead. Around the 13-second mark, a motorcyclist is visible on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the self-driving vehicle. No sudden or dangerous maneuvers are observed from other vehicles or the motorcyclist. The road is relatively clear of debris, and the weather appears sunny.",

The driver appears to be maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle in front. There is no evidence of braking or acceleration beyond normal driving adjustments.",
