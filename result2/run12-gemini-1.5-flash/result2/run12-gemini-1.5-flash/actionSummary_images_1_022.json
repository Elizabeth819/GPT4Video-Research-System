    "summary": "The video shows a car driving on a city road.  Traffic is moderate.  The car maintains a consistent speed and lane position for most of the sequence. Around the 5-second mark, a man in a light blue t-shirt and light-colored pants crosses the road in a pedestrian crossing. A cyclist is visible on the right side of the road in the later frames. No near misses or dangerous incidents occur.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second sequence.  The vehicle slows slightly as it approaches the pedestrian crossing around the 5-second mark, then resumes its previous speed after the pedestrian has safely crossed. The vehicle navigates a relatively clear road with moderate traffic.",

On the right side of the road, a cyclist is riding along the bike lane.  Between frames 1 and 2, the white van continues to move forward at a slow pace, and the cyclist maintains their position and speed. No immediate threats or dangerous actions are observed.",
