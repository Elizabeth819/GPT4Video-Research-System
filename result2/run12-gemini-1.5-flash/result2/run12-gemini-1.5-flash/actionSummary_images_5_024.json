Several other vehicles are visible, including cars and what appears to be a motorized scooter. Pedestrians are also present, crossing the street and walking along the sidewalks. The road is wet due to the rain.  No significant events or near misses are observed in this segment. The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second clip.",

The vehicle navigates a city street intersection, slowing slightly as it approaches the crosswalk where pedestrians are present.  The vehicle's speed appears to be adjusted based on the traffic conditions and pedestrian activity. The driver's actions suggest cautious and safe driving behavior in response to the wet road conditions and presence of other vehicles and pedestrians.",
