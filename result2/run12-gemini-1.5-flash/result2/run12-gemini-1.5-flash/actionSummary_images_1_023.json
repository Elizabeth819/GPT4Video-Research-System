    "summary": "The video shows a car driving down a city street.  Several pedestrians are crossing a crosswalk. A person on a scooter or motorcycle appears to lose control and fall in front of the car. The car appears to brake slightly but the person falls onto the road. The incident occurs in the middle of the road, near the crosswalk.",
