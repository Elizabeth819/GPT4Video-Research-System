    "summary": "The video shows a light-colored sedan driving on a two-lane road.  The road is relatively clear with some vegetation visible on the sides.  Around 5.2 seconds into the video, a motorcyclist wearing dark clothing appears from the right side of the road, seemingly turning left into the road from a side street or driveway. The motorcyclist's speed is moderate, and the distance to the self-driving vehicle is not immediately critical, but it requires attention due to the sudden appearance and potential for conflict.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the observed segment. There are no observable changes in speed or direction in response to other vehicles.",
    "key_objects": "Right side: A motorcyclist wearing dark clothing, approximately 15 meters away at initial appearance, turning left into the self-vehicle's lane from a side road. The motorcyclist's speed is moderate, and the distance is decreasing.",
