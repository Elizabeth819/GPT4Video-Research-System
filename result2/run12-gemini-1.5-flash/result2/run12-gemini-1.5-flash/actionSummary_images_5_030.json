    "summary": "The video shows a white sedan driving down a city street with moderate traffic.  The road is relatively clear, with parked cars along the sides.  Traffic is moving at a moderate pace.  Several pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks and briefly crossing the street.  Around the 8-second mark, a person on an electric scooter is seen crossing the street from the right side, requiring the driver to slightly adjust their speed. No near misses or dangerous incidents occur.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second segment.  The vehicle's speed appears to be adjusted slightly around the 8-second mark in response to a person on an electric scooter crossing the road. This adjustment is minor and does not involve braking or significant speed reduction. The vehicle navigates the street smoothly, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.",

    "summary": "The video shows the observer vehicle driving on a city street.  A person on an electric scooter is visible in the middle of the road, moving slowly.  Two pedestrians are standing near a red food cart on the right side of the road. The scooter rider appears to be crossing the road, and the pedestrians are relatively stationary. The observer vehicle maintains a steady speed, and there is no immediate danger of collision, although the scooter rider's position in the road is unsafe.",
