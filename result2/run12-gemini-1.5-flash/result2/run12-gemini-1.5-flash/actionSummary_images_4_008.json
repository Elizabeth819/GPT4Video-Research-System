Several other vehicles are visible in the distance, maintaining a safe distance from each other. A pedestrian is visible walking on the sidewalk to the right of the road. No sudden or erratic movements are observed from other vehicles or pedestrians. The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second segment.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed and lane position throughout the 10-second segment.  The vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, appropriate for the urban environment and light traffic conditions. There are no observed changes in speed or direction that suggest any immediate need for braking or evasive maneuvers.",

    "summary": "The video shows a car approaching an intersection.  A woman on an electric scooter, wearing dark clothing, crosses the intersection from right to left, appearing suddenly from behind a bus stop. The scooter is moving at a moderate speed. The car is maintaining a steady speed and appears to be making a slight left turn. The woman on the scooter nearly collides with the car, but the car manages to avoid a collision by slightly adjusting its trajectory.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle approaches an intersection and makes a slight left turn to avoid a collision with an electric scooter. The vehicle maintains a steady speed throughout the sequence. The slight turn is a reactive maneuver to avoid a potential accident.",
