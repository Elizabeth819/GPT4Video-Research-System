    "summary": "The video shows the self-driving vehicle navigating moderate urban traffic.  The road is relatively narrow with vehicles and motorcyclists moving in both directions.  Several motorcyclists are visible, some appearing to weave through traffic.  The traffic flow is generally slow and steady. No sudden or erratic movements are observed that would immediately endanger the self-driving vehicle.  The overall scene is typical of city driving conditions.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed, adjusting slightly to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.  The vehicle remains in its lane, navigating around slower-moving traffic.  The driver's actions appear cautious and reactive to the surrounding traffic conditions.",

The observer vehicle is stopped in traffic and does not move during this incident.  The child's scooter is dark-colored. The child crosses the road relatively quickly.",
