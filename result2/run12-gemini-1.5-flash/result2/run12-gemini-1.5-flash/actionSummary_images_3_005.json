    "summary": "The video shows a car driving on a city road.  The road is relatively clear with buildings lining both sides.  Around the 6-second mark, two pedestrians, one appearing to be female wearing dark clothing and the other partially obscured, cross the road at a pedestrian crossing.  A person on a scooter is also visible in the same area. The pedestrians cross in front of the recording vehicle, requiring the driver to slow down. No other significant events occur.",
    "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed for most of the 10-second segment, adjusting speed to safely navigate the pedestrian crossing around the 6-second mark. The deceleration is moderate and appears to be a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the pedestrians.",
    "key_objects": "Front: Two pedestrians, approximately 10 meters away at closest approach, crossing the road from right to left.  A person on a scooter is also visible near the pedestrians, approximately 12 meters away at closest approach, moving parallel to the road.",
