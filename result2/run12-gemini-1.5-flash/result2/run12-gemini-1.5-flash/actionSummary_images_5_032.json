    "summary": "The video shows a car driving down a road.  Several motorcycles are parked on the right side of the road. A motorcyclist on a black motorcycle pulls out from between parked motorcycles and into the path of the oncoming car. The motorcyclist falls, and the car appears to narrowly avoid a collision.  The motorcyclist appears to be a male, wearing dark clothing. The incident occurs near buildings and appears to be in an urban setting.",
    "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed, appearing to slightly brake after the motorcyclist falls. The vehicle stays in its lane and does not change direction.",
    "key_objects": "1) Front: Motorcyclist on a black motorcycle, approximately 5 meters away initially, suddenly pulling out from between parked motorcycles into the path of the car, causing near-miss collision. 2) Right: Parked motorcycles, partially obstructing the view of the approaching motorcyclist.",
