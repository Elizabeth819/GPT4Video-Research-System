    "summary": "The video shows a car driving on a narrow rural road.  Between 3.3s and 5.6s, two pedestrians, one appearing to be female wearing a dark coat and the other male in a lighter jacket, cross the road from right to left. They are approximately 10-15 meters ahead of the vehicle when they begin crossing.  Their crossing is relatively slow and they do not appear to rush. A motorcyclist is visible further ahead, traveling in the same direction as the recording vehicle. No immediate danger is presented by the pedestrians or motorcyclist. The road is relatively clear except for the pedestrians and motorcyclist.",
    "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed throughout the 10-second segment, adapting speed to the presence of pedestrians and the motorcyclist ahead.  The driver appears to maintain a safe following distance from the motorcyclist. No braking or acceleration is noticeably observed.",
