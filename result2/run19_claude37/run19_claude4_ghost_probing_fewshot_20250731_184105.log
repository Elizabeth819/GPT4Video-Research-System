without the actual images to analyze, i can't provide the detailed json response that identifies objects, actions, potential ghost probing behavior, or make predictions about appropriate next actions.

would you like to share the video frames so i can complete the analysis according to your requirements? once you share the images, i'll be able to carefully examine them for:

1. potential ghost probing behavior (both pedestrian and vehicle)
2. current driving actions with reasoning
3. next action predictions for speed control, direction control, and lane control
4. key objects and their relationship to key actions
