The driver maintains this speed despite the wet conditions and presence of a bus to the left and buildings with pedestrians to the right. When the pedestrian suddenly appears from the right and begins crossing, the vehicle needs to respond with immediate braking.

This is exactly what we're seeing in these dashcam images - a pedestrian suddenly appearing from the right side of the road, partially obscured initially by buildings and other visual elements.\n\nThe term is quite vivid in Chinese, with \"ghost\" (鬼) suggesting the sudden, unexpected appearance and \"probing head\" (探头) referring to the way the person or vehicle suddenly emerges into view. This phenomenon is considered particularly dangerous because it leaves drivers with very little reaction time.\n\nLooking at the sequence again with this specific knowledge, we can confirm this is indeed a classic \"ghost probing\" situation, where the pedestrian suddenly appears in the vehicle's path with minimal warning time due to visual obstruction, creating a dangerous situation that requires immediate braking.\n\nThe vehicle should rapidly decelerate to avoid hitting the pedestrian who is crossing the road. The wet road conditions (visible in the images) make this situation even more dangerous as it may increase braking distance."
