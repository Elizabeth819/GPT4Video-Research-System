The driver appears to be keeping a safe distance from vehicles ahead, particularly the red truck visible in several frames. The consistent spacing suggests appropriate speed control for the environment. The vehicle remains centered in its lane throughout the sequence, with no lane changes or erratic movements. When the pedestrian appears in image 13, there's no visible change in vehicle position yet, suggesting the driver may still be processing the sudden appearance of the pedestrian.\",\n    \"key_objects\": \"1) Right side: A long gray/brown wall running continuously along the right side of the road, 3-5 meters away, creating a visual obstruction that could hide pedestrians until they emerge. 2) Left side: Various buildings, shops and parked vehicles, 5-10 meters away, creating potential blind spots. 3) Front: Red truck visible intermittently, approximately 30-50 meters ahead, serving as a reference point for traffic flow. 4) Right side: A pedestrian in dark clothing, approximately 10 meters away in image 13, suddenly appearing near the wall and crossing into the vehicle's path.\",\n    \"key_actions\": \"ghost probing\",\n    \"next_action\": {\n        \"speed_control\": \"deceleration\",\n        \"direction_control\": \"keep direction\",\n        \"lane_control\": \"maintain current lane\"\n    }\n}\n```"
