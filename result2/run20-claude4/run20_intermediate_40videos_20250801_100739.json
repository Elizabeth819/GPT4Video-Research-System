In the middle of the sequence, a small child becomes visible on the right side of the street but remains at a safe distance from the roadway. The vehicle maintains steady progress through the area, navigating around parked vehicles and maintaining appropriate spacing from other road users. The overall scene represents normal urban driving conditions without immediate safety threats.\",\n    \"actions\": \"The self-driving vehicle maintains consistent moderate speed throughout the sequence, appropriate for the narrow urban street conditions. The vehicle demonstrates careful navigation around parked buses and trucks on both sides of the road. When the child appears on the right side in the middle frames, the vehicle continues at steady speed as the child remains safely positioned away from the vehicle's path on the sidewalk area.
