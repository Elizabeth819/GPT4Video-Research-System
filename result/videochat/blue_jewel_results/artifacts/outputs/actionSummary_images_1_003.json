    "summary": "During normal urban driving conditions, a pedestrian unexpectedly enters the vehicle's path from a concealed position. VideoChat2 analysis reveals typical ghost probing characteristics: limited visibility, sudden movement patterns, and inadequate reaction time. The incident highlights the challenges of pedestrian detection in complex urban environments where objects and infrastructure can obstruct clear sight lines.",
    "actions": "Immediate deceleration applied, defensive steering maneuver executed, warning systems engaged",
    "key_objects": "1) Front center, 15-20m: Pedestrian suddenly emerging from concealed position, rapid lateral movement creating immediate collision risk. 2) Right side, 25m: Parked vehicles obstructing visibility, static but contributing to sight line blockage. 3) Left lane, 30m: Oncoming traffic maintaining normal flow, potential secondary hazard for evasive maneuvers.",
