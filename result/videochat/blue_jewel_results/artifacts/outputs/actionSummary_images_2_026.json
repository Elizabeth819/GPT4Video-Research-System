    "summary": "During normal urban driving conditions, a pedestrian unexpectedly enters the vehicle's path from a concealed position. VideoChat2 analysis reveals typical ghost probing characteristics: limited visibility, sudden movement patterns, and inadequate reaction time. The incident highlights the challenges of pedestrian detection in complex urban environments where objects and infrastructure can obstruct clear sight lines.",
    "actions": "Immediate deceleration applied, defensive steering maneuver executed, warning systems engaged",
    "key_objects": "1) Center front, 12-18m: Child pedestrian appearing unexpectedly, erratic movement pattern with high collision probability. 2) Right periphery, 20-25m: Large vehicle creating visual obstruction, static positioning blocking driver's view. 3) Intersection area, 35m: Traffic signals and infrastructure creating complex navigation environment.",
