    "summary": "The vehicle encounters a dangerous scenario where a pedestrian appears suddenly in the driving path, having been previously hidden from view. VideoChat2's HD analysis identifies this as a high-risk ghost probing event, characterized by the pedestrian's unpredictable trajectory and the driver's limited response time. Emergency braking and evasive maneuvers are required to prevent collision.",
    "actions": "Immediate deceleration applied, defensive steering maneuver executed, warning systems engaged",
    "key_objects": "1) Front center, 15-20m: Pedestrian suddenly emerging from concealed position, rapid lateral movement creating immediate collision risk. 2) Right side, 25m: Parked vehicles obstructing visibility, static but contributing to sight line blockage. 3) Left lane, 30m: Oncoming traffic maintaining normal flow, potential secondary hazard for evasive maneuvers.",
