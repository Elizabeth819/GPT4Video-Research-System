    "characters": "Multiple pedestrians with one moving unpredictably, vehicle occupants, and surrounding traffic",
    "summary": "The vehicle encounters a dangerous scenario where a pedestrian appears suddenly in the driving path, having been previously hidden from view. VideoChat2's HD analysis identifies this as a high-risk ghost probing event, characterized by the pedestrian's unpredictable trajectory and the driver's limited response time. Emergency braking and evasive maneuvers are required to prevent collision.",
    "actions": "Rapid speed reduction, evasive lane adjustment, emergency response protocol activated",
    "key_objects": "1) Center front, 12-18m: Child pedestrian appearing unexpectedly, erratic movement pattern with high collision probability. 2) Right periphery, 20-25m: Large vehicle creating visual obstruction, static positioning blocking driver's view. 3) Intersection area, 35m: Traffic signals and infrastructure creating complex navigation environment.",
