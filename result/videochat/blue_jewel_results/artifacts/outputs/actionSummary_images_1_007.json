    "summary": "The vehicle encounters a dangerous scenario where a pedestrian appears suddenly in the driving path, having been previously hidden from view. VideoChat2's HD analysis identifies this as a high-risk ghost probing event, characterized by the pedestrian's unpredictable trajectory and the driver's limited response time. Emergency braking and evasive maneuvers are required to prevent collision.",
    "actions": "Immediate deceleration applied, defensive steering maneuver executed, warning systems engaged",
    "key_objects": "1) Immediate front, 10-15m: Adult pedestrian with sudden appearance, diagonal crossing trajectory posing severe threat. 2) Background right, 30m: Commercial vehicles limiting sight lines, stationary but vision-compromising. 3) Adjacent lanes, 25-40m: Multiple vehicles in normal traffic flow, complicating emergency response options.",
