    "summary": "During normal urban driving conditions, a pedestrian unexpectedly enters the vehicle's path from a concealed position. VideoChat2 analysis reveals typical ghost probing characteristics: limited visibility, sudden movement patterns, and inadequate reaction time. The incident highlights the challenges of pedestrian detection in complex urban environments where objects and infrastructure can obstruct clear sight lines.",
    "actions": "Immediate deceleration applied, defensive steering maneuver executed, warning systems engaged",
    "key_objects": "1) Immediate front, 10-15m: Adult pedestrian with sudden appearance, diagonal crossing trajectory posing severe threat. 2) Background right, 30m: Commercial vehicles limiting sight lines, stationary but vision-compromising. 3) Adjacent lanes, 25-40m: Multiple vehicles in normal traffic flow, complicating emergency response options.",
