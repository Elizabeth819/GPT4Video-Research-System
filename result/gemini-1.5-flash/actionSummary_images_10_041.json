The white sedan is seen moving from the left side to the right side of the frame, indicating a potential cut-in behavior. The black car is stationary on the right side, and the silver van is moving slowly on the left side. The road is well-lit with buildings on both sides.",
        "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is maintaining a steady speed while navigating through the traffic. The driver is likely being cautious due to the presence of multiple vehicles and the potential cut-in behavior of the white sedan. The vehicles speed remains consistent to avoid sudden braking or collisions.",
        "key_objects": "1) Left side: A white sedan, approximately 5 meters away, moving from left to right, potentially cutting into the self-vehicles lane. 2) Right side: A black car, approximately 3 meters away, stationary. 3) Left side: A silver van, approximately 7 meters away, moving slowly.",
