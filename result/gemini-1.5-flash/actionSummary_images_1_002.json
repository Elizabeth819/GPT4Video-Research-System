They are walking towards the vehicle.  A motorcycle is also approaching from the right side of the road, approximately 20 meters away. The adults' crossing behavior presents a potential ghost probing scenario, as they are not initially visible due to the distance and could suddenly step into the vehicle's path. The motorcycle's approach from the right also presents a potential hazard.",
