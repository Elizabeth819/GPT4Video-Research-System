At 2.0s, a blue truck suddenly appears from the left side, moving into the self-driving vehicles lane, causing the vehicle to decelerate. The truck continues to move ahead, maintaining a close distance. At 9.0s, a pedestrian appears from the right side, crossing the road in front of the self-driving vehicle, causing the vehicle to decelerate further.",
        "actions": "The self-driving vehicle decelerates rapidly at 2.0s due to the sudden appearance of the blue truck from the left side, which moves into the vehicles lane. The vehicle maintains a reduced speed to keep a safe distance from the truck ahead. At 9.0s, the vehicle decelerates further to avoid a pedestrian crossing from the right side.",
        "key_objects": "1) Left side: A blue truck, approximately 2 meters away, moving into the self-driving vehicles lane, causing rapid deceleration. 2) Right side: A pedestrian, approximately 5 meters away, crossing the road in front of the self-driving vehicle, causing further deceleration.",
