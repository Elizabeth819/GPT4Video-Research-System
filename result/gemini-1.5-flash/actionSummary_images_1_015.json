One is wearing a dark shirt, the other a light shirt. This action creates a potential ghost probing scenario, posing an immediate risk of collision. The speed of the individuals is difficult to ascertain from the limited frames, but their sudden appearance necessitates immediate action from the driver.",

The driver appears to be cautiously navigating the narrow street, likely due to the presence of parked vehicles and limited visibility around corners. The consistent speed suggests a proactive approach to managing potential hazards.",
