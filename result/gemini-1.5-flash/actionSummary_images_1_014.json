At approximately 1.7 seconds, a person on a motorized tricycle, appearing to be an adult male wearing dark clothing, is seen initially stationary near the roadside.  Between 1.7s and 3.3s, the tricycle starts moving slowly into the road from the right side, creating a potential collision hazard. This sudden movement from a partially obscured position constitutes a 'ghost probing' event. The driver of the car needs to react quickly to avoid a collision.",
