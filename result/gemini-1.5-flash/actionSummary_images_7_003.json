The self-driving vehicle is following a black car closely, while a green truck is on the right side. The black car ahead suddenly slows down, causing the self-driving vehicle to decelerate. The green truck on the right side starts to merge into the self-driving vehicles lane, creating a potential cut-in situation.",
