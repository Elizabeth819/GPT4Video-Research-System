The child's sudden appearance presents a significant ghost probing hazard.  Simultaneously, a person on a motorcycle approaches the intersection from the right, also crossing the road. While the motorcycle rider is more visible, their crossing path still presents a potential collision risk. The speed of the scooter is relatively low, but the sudden appearance is the critical factor. The motorcycle is moving at a moderate speed. Both situations require immediate driver attention and potential braking.",
