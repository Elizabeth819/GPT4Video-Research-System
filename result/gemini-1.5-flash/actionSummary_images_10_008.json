A young boy, approximately 8-10 years old, wearing a light blue shirt, is riding a scooter across the road directly in front of the vehicle. The boy's actions are unpredictable, creating a potential ghost probing scenario. The boy is approximately 5 meters away from the vehicle at the start of the sequence and appears to be moving at a moderate pace. The road is wet due to rain, potentially affecting braking distance.",

The vehicle's path remains straight, suggesting no need for steering adjustments.
