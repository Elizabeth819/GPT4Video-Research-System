        "summary": "In this segment, the self-driving vehicle is traveling on a busy urban road. Multiple pedestrians and vehicles are present. A pedestrian suddenly appears from the right side, crossing the road in front of the self-driving vehicle, causing a potential ghost probing situation. Additionally, a motorcyclist with a passenger is seen moving from the right side to the left side of the road, potentially causing a cut-in situation.",
        "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is maintaining a consistent speed while navigating through the busy urban road. The vehicles speed is steady, and it is keeping a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. However, due to the sudden appearance of the pedestrian from the right side, the vehicle may need to decelerate rapidly to avoid a collision.",
        "key_objects": "1) Right side: A pedestrian, approximately 2 meters away, suddenly crossing the road, causing a potential ghost probing situation. 2) Right side: A motorcyclist with a passenger, approximately 5 meters away, moving from the right side to the left side of the road, potentially causing a cut-in situation.",
