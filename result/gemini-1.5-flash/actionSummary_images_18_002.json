A man, appearing to be between 30-40 years old, wearing a dark jacket and pants, walks slowly across the vehicle's path from behind a parked car. This action constitutes a 'ghost probing' event, as the man emerges suddenly from the car's blind spot, creating a potential collision. The man's slow walking speed reduces the immediate danger, but the lack of awareness of the approaching vehicle is concerning.",
