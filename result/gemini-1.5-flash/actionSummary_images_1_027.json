The driving conditions appear to be normal, with good visibility and no apparent hazards.",

He suddenly falls down in the middle of the road from the right side, creating an immediate hazard for the approaching vehicle. The fall appears unexpected and rapid, leaving little time for the driver to react. This constitutes a 'ghost probing' event due to the sudden appearance of an obstacle in the vehicle's path from a previously unobstructed area.",
