No pedestrians or other vehicles are observed entering the road or exhibiting dangerous behavior during this short segment. The road is relatively smooth, with minor imperfections visible on the surface. The car ahead is traveling at a consistent speed, and the self-driving vehicle maintains a similar speed, keeping a safe distance.",
