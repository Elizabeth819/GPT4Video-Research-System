One man, appearing to be 30-40 years old, wearing a dark jacket, suddenly steps out from behind the group into the road directly in front of the observer vehicle. This action creates a potential ghost probing situation, requiring immediate braking action from the driver. The speed of the pedestrian's movement is relatively fast, leaving little reaction time for the driver.",
