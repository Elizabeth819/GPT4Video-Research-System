Initially, the road is clear, but as the vehicle progresses, a motorcycle appears from the right side and moves across the road. Subsequently, a pedestrian suddenly emerges from the left side, very close to the vehicle, causing a potential collision risk.",
        "actions": "The self-driving vehicle maintains a consistent speed initially. As the motorcycle appears from the right side and moves across the road, the vehicle starts to decelerate. The sudden appearance of the pedestrian from the left side forces the vehicle to rapidly decelerate to avoid a collision.",
        "key_objects": "1) Right side: A motorcycle, approximately 10 meters away, moving across the road. 2) Left side: A pedestrian, approximately 1 meter away, suddenly emerging from the left side, causing immediate danger.",
