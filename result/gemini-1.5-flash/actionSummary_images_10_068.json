A black sedan is moving from the left to the right side of the frame, crossing the intersection. A blue taxi is seen moving from the left side of the frame towards the center, eventually cutting into the self-driving vehicles lane.",
        "actions": "The self-driving vehicle is maintaining a consistent speed while approaching the intersection. The vehicle is likely preparing to stop or slow down due to the presence of the cyclist and the black sedan crossing the intersection. The blue taxis movement from the left side of the frame towards the center indicates a potential cut-in behavior, causing the self-driving vehicle to decelerate.",
