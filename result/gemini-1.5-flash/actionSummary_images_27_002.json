On the right side of the road, a motorcycle is initially parked. At approximately 3.3 seconds into the video, the motorcyclist starts to move, creating a potential ghost probing scenario. The motorcyclist's sudden movement from a relatively stationary position poses a risk of collision with the approaching car. The speed of the motorcycle is moderate, but the suddenness of the movement is the primary concern. The car is driving at a slow, cautious speed, likely due to the road conditions and the presence of other vehicles and potential obstacles.",

This cautious driving is likely a response to the narrow, unpaved road conditions and the presence of other vehicles and potential obstacles.
