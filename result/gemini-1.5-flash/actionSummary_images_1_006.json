A group of motorcyclists and scooter riders are seen in front of the car, some appearing to attempt to cross the road without fully yielding to oncoming traffic. This creates a potential ghost probing scenario, as the riders emerge from between other vehicles, creating a sudden and unexpected obstacle for the car. The riders' behavior is erratic, with some weaving through traffic and others seemingly ignoring traffic signals. The potential for a collision is high due to the close proximity of the riders to the car and their unpredictable movements. The speed of the approaching motorcyclists and scooter riders is moderate, but their unpredictable behavior increases the risk of a collision.",

This is likely a precautionary measure due to the presence of other vehicles and the potential for pedestrians or cyclists to cross the road unexpectedly. The driver is likely observing the traffic conditions closely and preparing to stop or slow down further if necessary.",
