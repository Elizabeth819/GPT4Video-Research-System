Initially, the cyclist's speed appears moderate, but it increases as he gets closer to the car. This sudden increase in speed and the cyclist's initial distance create a potential 'ghost probing' scenario, as the cyclist emerges into the vehicle's path with little warning. The cyclist's behavior poses a significant risk of collision.",
