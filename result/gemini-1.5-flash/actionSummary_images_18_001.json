At approximately 5.0 seconds, a white van is visible ahead, approximately 15 meters away, traveling at a moderate speed. A person on a motorcycle is seen approaching from the left lane at a high speed. At approximately 6.4 seconds, the motorcyclist cuts in front of the van, causing the van to brake suddenly. The motorcyclist's action is a cut-in maneuver, creating a dangerous situation. At 7.8 seconds, the impact of the collision is visible, with the windshield of the self-driving vehicle shattered. The motorcyclist's high speed and sudden cut-in maneuver are the primary factors contributing to the accident.",
