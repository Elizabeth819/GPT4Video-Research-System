A man on a scooter, wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants, appears to be in his 30s or 40s, is seen approaching from the center of the road and crossing directly in front of the vehicle. The scooter rider does not appear to check for oncoming traffic before crossing. This action constitutes a 'ghost probing' event due to the sudden appearance of the scooter in the vehicle's path, leaving minimal reaction time for the driver. The speed of the scooter appears to be moderate, adding to the potential danger.",
        "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed throughout the 5-second segment.  There are no observable changes in speed or direction. The driver appears to be maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead. The consistent speed suggests the driver is navigating a relatively clear section of the road with no immediate need for braking or acceleration.",

The men are approximately 5 meters in front of the vehicle.  The driver needs to react quickly to avoid a potential accident. The situation is classified as 'ghost probing' due to the sudden appearance of the men in the road and the lack of time for the driver to react.",
