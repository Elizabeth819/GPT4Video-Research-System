Initially, the road is clear, but a white sedan appears ahead and slows down, causing the self-driving vehicle to decelerate. A yellow truck is parked on the right side of the road, partially blocking the lane. The white sedan then changes lanes to the left, moving ahead of the self-driving vehicle.",
