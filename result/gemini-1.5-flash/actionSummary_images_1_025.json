She is initially visible in the left side of the frame at approximately 15 meters distance from the vehicle. Her crossing of the road is sudden and unexpected, presenting a significant risk of collision. The speed of her crossing is moderate, giving the driver limited reaction time. This behavior is classified as 'ghost probing' due to her unexpected appearance in the vehicle's path.",
        "actions": "The vehicle maintains a consistent speed throughout the 5-second segment. There are no observable changes in speed or direction. The driver appears to be maintaining a safe distance from the road edge and proceeding straight ahead. The consistent speed suggests the driver is navigating a relatively clear and straight section of road.",
