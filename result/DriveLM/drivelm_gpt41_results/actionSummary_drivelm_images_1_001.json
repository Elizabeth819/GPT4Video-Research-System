Suddenly, a child runs out from the right side of the road into the direct path of the ego vehicle, appearing abruptly and creating an immediate collision risk. The child is not visible in the initial frames and emerges from a blind spot near a building. The ego vehicle is forced to perform an emergency stop to avoid a collision. After the incident, the road clears and normal traffic resumes.",
