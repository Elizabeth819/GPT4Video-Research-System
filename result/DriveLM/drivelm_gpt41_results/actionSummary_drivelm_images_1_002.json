As the vehicle approaches, a child suddenly runs from the right side of the road directly into the vehicle's path, creating an immediate collision risk. The driver is forced to perform emergency braking to avoid hitting the child. Other pedestrians remain on the sidewalk or roadside.",

There are a few vehicles ahead, but no immediate traffic participants or pedestrians in the ego lane or its vicinity. The road is straight, and there is a visible intersection warning sign, but no dynamic objects are entering the ego vehicle's path.
